really close 99 chance go wishes though probably told marrying someone another country heck even slightly different community huge deal india having job independent would give standing give decisions like deciding marry weight respect community my cousin dating gf 6 years also india different state told parents waiting get good job when i told parents girlfriend indian christian fights tears several months mother could talk entire month this despite fact comparatively progressive family several relatives including living abroad and exponentially harder girl india still quite patriarchal women asserting independence cause major freakouts so please realise you you convince anything explain important etc etc she already knows things and agrees things she side however careful manoeuvres required inform parents extended family leave decisions she taken first steps telling sister mother my guess mother still getting acclimatized idea and tells father would need mother support if mother support even father gets upset gf someone inside mom placate otherwise things could get ugly fast again it unfortunate indian families like but tight family bonds lead much supportive connected loving family structure blows wo regret it people old fashioned need time come terms big changes all life parents probably ideas wedding would like kind groom find suddenly make 180 things simply believed lives similar issues arise parents want tell rest family there lot things consider things like timing maybe first slowly introducing idea dating someone without revealing they may also want go person discussion in case family move carefully planned even particularly close dependant extended family if want make things easier make efforts understand culture learn bit language buy traditional indian

0,did sharad pawar ncp congress shiv sena defeat bjp greatest game political chess played india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/,after weeks political maneuvering backstabbing drama made television series would rival game thrones house cards talking s8 got s6 hoc looks like finally getting clarity happening happened happen maharashtra if following happened the people maharashtra voted state elections the primary alliances competing elections nda made bjp shiv sena upa made ncp congress bjp lost 17 seats shiv sena lost 7 congress gained 2 seats ncp gained 13 bjp got largest share votes individual party got enough seats form majority government required number seats form government maharashtra vidhan sabha 145 after results declared shiv sena refused form government bjp demands equal share power post cm years met the governor member bjp rss btw 8th 11th november invited bjp shiv sena ncp form government prove majority after parties either refused failed prove majority president rule imposed 12th november meanwhile congress ncp shiv sena historically opposed opposed congress ncp vastly different ideology compared ncp congress entered alliance together form government before could form government though ajit pawar nephew sharad pawar chosen representative away ncp along mlas joined hands bjp form government on 23 november am governor revoked president rule accepted formation pawar government administering oath office devendra fadnavis became cm entered second term ajit pawar became deputy cm suspiciously around time corruption charges investigations ajit pawar dropped the congress ncp shiv sena challenged formation government supreme court demanded floor test sharad pawar publicly disavowed ajit pawar actions the supreme court directed new government prove majority evening today today unable prove majority devendra fadnavis ajit pawar resigned new government dissolved what happening ist happen the congress ncp shiv sena form government uddhav thackeray cm mlas three parties trident hotel rn elect uddhav cm ajit pawar mlas ncp back ncp pawar deputy edit still left seen ajit pawar fate process reconciliation seems already started the terms power sharing afaik still unknown probably shiv sena ncp hold cm post years congress play supporting role three parties sharing equal power edit what follows speculation side imo probable might happened now might seem like crazy series events i ca help feel events shiv sena entered alliance ncp congress carefully orchestrated three parties especially sharad pawar i believe shown amit shah shah still amateur game pawar veteran sharad pawar co managed alliance although alliance always rocky pawar co managed split natural alliance bjp shiv sena borne shared hindutva idealogy simultaneously managing form alliance bitter rivals bjp forming government now seems super obvious impressive considering fact bjp netted amount votes election hypocrisy bjp bjp always run platform stated party government corrupt unlike opposition multiple huge corruption scandals it one major reasons 2014 now saga ajit pawar lets face never seriously splitting ncp ploy sharad pawar managed expose corrupt nature bjp public manner ajit pawar jail this cherry top pawar co possibly stinging thing happen bjp whole saga pawar managed expose corruption bjp also managed save nephew consequences corruption using enemy salvation now great dandy pawar ncp shiv sena congress mean us observers voters maharashtra well conclusions i ended whole saga is i sure voters voted shiv sena wanted bjp power voters voted ncp congress want shiv sena power feeling duped betrayed angry rn good reason if ultimately choice population even matter point democracy what point voting might well choose next government based better jenga monopoly sharad pawar uddhav thackeray devendra fadnavis balasaheb thorat ideology and principles do all matters power yeah congress ncp shiv sena managed defeat bjp cost all parties involved betrayed core principles ideas upon parties found entering alliance why even separate parties do matter all 3 parties betrayed trust voters supporters placed meanwhile bjp betrayed trust general public lays institutions figures like governor supposed neutral sharad pawar co might managed win greatest game political chess played india rest us common folk lost regardless political ideology believe party support i hope agree i say entire saga dark period democracy india edit we still ca say sure whole ajit pawar saga carefully constructed ploy actually betrayed know make rash decisions sharad pawar he present joint press conference parties uddhav thackeray announced cm ncp members asked sharad pawar ensure ajit pawar back fold asap so still unclear i definitely say sure whether intention helped alliance,as someone follow politics thank summarising everything happened i confused wtf going time appreciate effort post hardly greatest yes for shah at game less whatever happened good 1 shivsena longer hindutva party entered third phase 1st may 2nd hindutva 3rd shades sons soil politics gives lot space maneuver 2 ncp shivsena congress going formidable coalition however might issues fight next election something way future 3 bjp backfoot room grow it longer restricted shivsena terms seat sharing but never get majority tough task ahead especially string losses various states it think venturing new territories like sure shot it might even lose jharkhand 4 this also brings end somewhat ideological fights there 2 left bjp 5 ka dhong band karna every party craves power that ideology thanks detailed breakdown as nri i ca really seem trust mainstream news completely almost every one agenda paid politicians i would give silver i coins here fake silver people like pawar devegowda lallu n next level like bsy siddu dkshi etc sorry quoting ka names sure others well versed play game unlike pseudo chanakyas know language threat temptation money not always one win misusing power proven yet is x200b people vote parties though ideally design they vote individual representatives thats i party system after results declared shiv sena refused form government bjp demands equal share power post cm years met i disagree we know bjp promised cm post hence ca decide ss one blame alliance falling apart though course become made popular narrative and seem like sp pulling fast one bjp bjp committing suicide they election when ss refused play second fiddle play victim card claim moral high ground when state went would narrative favour what i think happened fadnavis tried assert bit could chew he assured delhi would get bjp majority which i think probably promise ss cm seat rotation basis would splitting votes intending backstab simple majority they made position vulnerable he enemies within state bjp get along nitin gadkari he then drama played whether tried poach ncp mlas pawar played whole thing happened bjp fadnavis arrogance owes position the duo needed stay power could influence state traditionally good relations outsiders gujaratis particular due splitting bombay state needed remain power gadkari faction how tug war fadnavis gadkari results maharashtra stalemate https maharashtra politics are efforts edge devendra fadnavis https ajit pawar mlas ncp back ncp ajit pawar deputy cm lmao whaat the game begun the happened karnataka look power it battle survival shiv sena pawar helped it going mean anything ncp share power government but shiv sena means everything balasaheb man hypothetically comes back demands sena workers bring heads every sena mla right party cadres would 20 minutes not going character ideology balasaheb good bad ugly pull even bjp knew ca mess they accepted lesser power two after balasaheb bjp realized could bigger partner and sena saw ground slipping they maharashtra bjp whole country if let become senior partner would sena survive 10 years in battle survival befriend devils hate a bhakt told fadnavis got cm chair first thing clear farmer relief fund turned true but yeah still think shit display parties more entertaining hbo netflix series democracy is dead i pretty sure indian democracy exceeds lives allotted cat every week given number times pronounced dead it fun make strong hyperbolic statements innit the mandate bjp ss the work govt lead 3 parties combined 48 vote share was really mandate sure have proven greedy pigs sure yes is bad mh will see return blatant corruption cancellation bjp pet infra projects probably will effects political game play next election it stupid expect bjp revise alliance arrangements wrt shiv sena ultimately coalition parties represent largest share mandate 48 total votes if i adding 16 16 16 correctly i gon na hazard guess say yes these games matter what matters keeping alliance together this closest seen successful implementation fabled mahagathbandan making ghatbandan work maharashtra go long way proving feasibility voters these three parties need keep mind play long game focus delivering results people will solve lot problems well written post this victory remarkable resistance ruthless power i think scenario similar saw karnataka fractured mandate bjp biased governor hurriedly installs bjp cm opponents unite run government years bjp uses central investigation agencies go corrupt opponents government falls mlas migrate bjp fear opportunity bjp comes back power unless aap becomes strong stopping bjp long run this truly scary worse pawar dealt death blow combine their air invincibility broken modi gon na take loss kindly the voices bjp rss gon na fanned shah vulnerable vultures circling overhead corruption charges investigations ajit pawar dropped this one correct though acb released statement saying open enquiries closed ajit pawar none anything irrigation scam he around 40 cases apparently appreciate effort articulate saga entirely though great job excellent summary thank democracy is dead hold grandiloquent pronouncements shiv sena bjp living hindutva votebank appeal class voters if contest elections separately hindutva votebank split none win so alliance convenience let parties remain relevant dishonouring alliance constitution technically democracy dead yet what pawar 1 first gets shiv sena stick formula alliance collapses 2 then gets shiv sena quit nda 3 then gets bjp drop cases ajit pawar 4 then forces ajit quit fadnavis quit twice within 2 weeks pawar ensured a bjp egg face b get accused subverting democratic norms c besmirched reputations highest constitutional offices it indeed greatest game ever played pawar open school niti taught now might seem like crazy series events i ca help feel events shiv sena entered alliance ncp congress carefully orchestrated three parties especially sharad pawar i believe shown amit shah shah still amateur game pawar veteran i agree the alliance rocky since 2014 there tacit understanding balasahebs time bjp would always play second fiddle sena maharashtra in 2014 got reversed they went along bjp 2014 bjp seats could cobble coalition smaller parties like rpi raju shetty party etc etc sena even asked central minister resign steel portfolio this fight survival sena they got moment struck right time pawar might helped mostly uddhavs awfully looks like public choice one 1 bjp wins the parties keep integrity the public loses big time bjp reigns supreme 2 bjp loses the parties give away integrity the public loses little less bjp invulnerability breaks given fucked leveraging justice political tool bjp used accusations ajit pawar leverage seems option 2 better long run one thing certain i never going vote indian election why bother cast vote ultimately traded power brokers like a part still says even though lost government one one pick pieces apart alliances well yeah governors neutral law why fuck case also president neutral law yet another puppet hands bjp ideology never mattered they sell mothers meant get power how long new collapse great post well summarised you also mention governor imposed president rule time given ncp prove majority elapsed another example bjp manipulated neutral institutions benefit hold horses though picture baaki hai ekach saheb pawar saheb amazing analysis i think using game chess analogy appropriate you ca really cheat game chess you ca switch pieces one looking ca make one move withdraw move opponent plays and importantly chess game people use brain power play game honor sportsmanship these fuckers crooks wo know place pawn board let alone king i good suggestions shove pieces board however these may dark days democracy also seeing people sit take notice underhanded skulduggery employed people if enough people take notice decide something things change and people analyzing displaying facts see first step towards sort positive change sharad pawar basically didnt thing shiv sena one betrayed pre poll alliance it destroyed next elections mmw the interesting question did ajit pawar resign first forcing dev fadnavis resign resign simultaneously all scripted thank you time wonderful writing put perspective what mean growth mumbai are people expecting growth stalled specially metro projects this play like karnataka just wait watch can agree sad month democracy why fuck guys accepting ajit pawar back why cone shame dismiss fucktard i disagree democracy dead i rather think new balance power keep alive a good government run good things strong ruling party votes also good strong opposition bjp going watch like hawk going much worried corrupt even appearing corrupt these might old people returning game game changed lot since played last sorry op democracy dead it probably taking nap distracted once wakes stab ass till bleeds this combination shiv sena ncp congress meant keeping away bjp power though bjp made efforts negate but bjp failed endeavors also exposed whole nation watched drama finally took deep breath decision apex court this episode paved way nation party kept away foul play and months bjp another karnataka i trying figure kind government i call indian government fascist oligarchy totalitarian extremes ofc i guess combination three no would mind summarising things happen india people like confused half time irritated half like weekly blog king pin pawar got nephew got back house this pretty intense speaking non political standpoint i points add posted thread arrangement inc managed break away perception anti hindu this big win seems major propaganda anti hindu so raga temple hopping janeu wearing could achieve achieved one move this big threat bjp future inc ncp avoided losing relevance if formed govt central govt would used machinery break away thereby causing damage sharad pawar could easily joined nda center got plum ministry daughter ajit but decided leave legacy daughter i feeling may play active role mh politics going forward bjp choice launch true reforms like reduction personal income tax would compete keep popularity i think wait atleast year confirm fucking ninja thanks ton op this good summary probably give continuation posts us redditors want facts unbiased opinions

great voyages during mughal empire end 16th century india wealth indeed sustain 100 million people with plenty arable land agriculture certainly productive western europe even peasant got decent india also large skilled workforce produced cotton also luxuries aristocracy consequently economy produced large financial surplus used support growing mughal empire finance spectacular monuments like taj in 1497 portuguese sent vasco da gama flotilla four ships find india wealth but voyage commercial success indians interested european clothes goods made far ones india but da gama told king manuel portugal large cities large buildings rivers great populations he spoke spices jewels precious stones mines he believed found india legendary it took english hundred years discover wealth initially came plunder soon discovered rewards trade they found india produced world best cotton yarn textiles enormous what indians wanted exchange europeans gold silver insatiable appetite hence constant flow gold india absorbed good deal bullion mined spaniards new world having learned cotton textiles india english turned tables brought industrial revolution britain destroyed lives millions indian weavers

industrial economy emerge india instead india become impoverished despite dynamic growing commercial sector responded market forces extensive foreign trade truth 18th century india significantly behind western europe technology institutions ideas neither agricultural revolution scientific revolution occurred long run manual skill indian artisan could substitute technological progress 14 would needed new attitudes notwithstanding surplus trade india per capita product perhaps england 15 there easy answer problem country prosperous people poor one explanation even 18th century india large population plenty cheap labor prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology when supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines hence englishman observed 1807 in india seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human 16 there easy answer problem country prosperous people poor one explanation even 18 century india large population plenty cheap labor prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology when supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines hence englishman observed 1807 in india seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human did british raj impoverish india india nationalist historians blamed british raj india poverty the classic nationalist case india rich british came colonialism weakened agriculture deindustrialized india throwing millions artisans work britain trade policies encouraged import manufactures export raw materials finally drained wealth india transferring capital britain nationalists claimed lancashire new textile mills crushed india handloom textile industry threw millions weavers work india textile exports plunged leadership position start britain industrial revolution fraction the indigenous banking system financed exports also destroyed since colonial government erect tariff barriers indian consumers shifted cheaper english cloth millions handloom workers left misery british colonial rule india favorite nationalist phrase exporter textiles india became exporter raw britain also changed old land revenue system disadvantage farmer pay revenue whether monsoon failed this led famines the worst one affected 96 million lives killed estimated 5 million people although railways helped trade food crops enlarged national market sucked away peasant surplus earlier stored bad years moreover british government transferred surplus revenues back england since india consistently exported imported second half 19th century early 20th century britain used india trade surplus finance trade deficit rest world pay exports india capital repayments london this represented massive drain india in recent years historians challenged nationalist picture they argued indian industry decline 19th century caused technology the machines britain industrial revolution wiped indian textiles way traditional handmade textiles disappeared europe rest world fifty years later indian textile mills would destroyed india weavers thus victims technological they also found land tax 1900 5 percent agricultural output half average per capita tax burden there drain wealth percent gnp every year the revisionist historians argued india payments britain real military civilian services service capital investments also overhead cost british called home charges fact quite if india army navy would spent true india balance payments surplus britain used finance part deficit india compensated import gold silver went private indian hands india begins indian entrepreneurs began set modern textile mills 1850 slowly began recapture domestic market in 1896 indian mills supplied 8 total cloth consumed india 1913 20 1936 62 1945 76 india participate global trade expansion 1870 1913 indian businessmen made large profits first world war reinvested war thus india manufacturing output grew percent per year well world average 22 the british government finally provided tariff protection 1920s helped industrialists expand diversify by independence 1947 indian entrepreneurs strong position buy businesses departing british industry share india gnp doubled percent 1913 percent 1947 share manufactures exports rose percent 1913 30 percent 1947 why industrial revolution occur one intriguing questions history india failed create industrial revolution karl marx predicted railways would transform india usher industrial revolution indeed first world war thought ready by 1914 india third largest railway network world largest jute manufacturing industry fourth largest cotton textile industry largest canal system percent world colony liberal regulatory regime far investor friendly one replaced 1920s infant industry also favored tariffs it merchant class hungry become industrialists industrialization fact pick war industry share national output doubled but enough broadly transform agricultural society modern industry employed million people population 350 million amiya kumar bagchi marxist economist suggests reason lack effective demand colonial period limited business opportunity indians poor buy modern goods if domestic indian market small could entrepreneur supplemented producing export morris morris blames supply an indian entrepreneur uncompetitive shortage technology skilled labor raised cost production the historian rajat ray argues indian businessmen export made inferior products unacceptable world market in view technological backwardness single biggest but surely could imported technology jamshedji tata birla others unlike nationalist historians i think british conspiracy deliberately india sabotage indian business interests bombay textile mills built credit technical assistance machines britain although competitive threat manchester mills i believe industrial revolution occur indian agriculture remained stagnant industrial revolution without agricultural surplus means feed rapidly growing urban population second international trading environment turned hostile protectionism first world war followed depression third colonial government educate masses unlike japanese state finally colonial mindset pervaded indian middle class even hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence politically enslaved what verdict british rule did british impoverish india there question 18th century plundered looted india wealth conquerors done history but create institutions india detriment this nature theory colonialism true industrial revolution threw millions weavers work would happened way new technology reached india british government policy could cushioned impact erecting trade barriers saved enormous amount human suffering protecting handlooms would temporary palliative odd may seem i believe britain exploit india enough had made massive investments india americas india would become prosperous much bigger market british goods a richer india would better customer better supplier firmer basis britain main failure educate indian 83 percent indians illiterate independence britain education system india produced thin upper crust extremely well educated indians masses remained although britain could lift indians poverty avert famines give india institutions democracy rule law independent judiciary free press it built railways canals harbors it gave india almost hundred years pax britannica although gave modern values institutions interfere ancient traditions religion hence india preserved spiritual heritage old way life continues many despair divisiveness caste hold indian way life also bulwark onslaught global culture independence after independence democracy took root india gradually masses acquired stake system periodically electing representatives even lowest castes the rulers also adopted fabian socialist economic path indians turn capitalism 1991 although modest liberalization economy 1980s thus india embraced democracy capitalism makes journey modernity unique explains good deal jawaharlal nehru planners trust private entrepreneurs made state entrepreneur surprisingly failed create industrial revolution instead india experienced agricultural revolution early 1970s it thus important industrial agricultural industrial eluded its investment rate also rose 6 percent well 20 per cent yet engender why i think least six things wrong india mantra one adopted path rather route thus denied share world trade prosperity trade brought era two set massive inefficient monopolistic public sector denied autonomy working hence investments productive poor ratio three private enterprise worst controls world diminished competition market four discouraged foreign capital denied benefits technology world class competition five pampered organized labor point extremely low productivity six ignored education children nehru strategic planner mahalanobis made two wrong assumptions he assumed opportunities rapid export expansion 1950s turned wrong india discovered tiny hong kong could earn exports whole india india share world trade declined percent 1947 percent 1990 he also assumed competition wasteful also flawed idea little improvement productivity without even damaging creeping controls private sector the bizarre licensing system it began industrial licensing act 1951 required entrepreneur get license set new unit expand change product mix a huge number untrained clerks engineers bureaucrats directorate general technical development operating basis inadequate information vetted thousands applications ad hoc basis these low level functionaries took months futile application finally sent approval administrative ministry the ministry lost months reviewing data sent application licensing committee after minister approval investor seek approval import machinery capital goods licensing committee if finance needed state financial institution scrutiny repeated afresh the result enormous delays sometimes lasting years staggering opportunities corruption large business houses set parallel bureaucracies delhi follow files organize bribes win licenses if entrepreneur finally get started made success enterprise trouble it offence punishable law manufacture beyond capacity granted license india became country world production sorely needed goods sorely punishable the system ended thwarting competition entrepreneurship growth without achieving social objectives it fostered monopolies proliferated plants remote uncompetitive locations employing technology bureaucrats clue basics running business made decisions choice technology size location plants although becoming clear india wrong path late sixties instead changing course nehru indira gandhi introduced controls she nationalized banks discouraged foreign investment placed hurdles domestic enterprise hence industrial growth plunged per cent year per cent productivity indian manufacturing declined half percent year 1960 effectively dark period indian 31 it harder blame nehru adopting economic wrong model socialism wisdom age dozens economists visited india hailed bold it right blame indira gandhi japan miracle evident korea taiwan following footsteps however ideology one part story an important reason poor implementation even nehru socialism could delivered degenerate license raj india reforms although modest liberalization 1980s decisive turning point came july 1991 minority government narasimha rao announced sweeping reforms it opened economy foreign investment trade dismantled import controls lowered customs duties devalued currency made rupee convertible trade account virtually abolished licensing controls private investment dropped tax rates broke public sector monopolies as result growth rose percent year three years row inflation came 13 percent 6 percent 1993 exchange reserves shot 1 billion 20 billion 1993 crossed 100 billion end 2003 this important turning point deng revolution china december 1978 surprisingly elected coalition governments succeeded rao continued reform process despite slow incremental pace made india one fastest growing major economies indians traditionally accorded high place making money hence merchant bania placed third hierarchy behind brahmin kshatriya step ahead laboring shudra after economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable sons brahmins kshatriyas began get mbas wanted become entrepreneurs the business pages newspapers became livelier chief ministers states scrambled private investment judges became industrial disputes as result india midst social revolution rivalled perhaps ascent japan merchant class 1968 meiji restoration there also mental revolution and changed attitude english illustrates new mindset ever since british left indians constantly carped english language but 1990s carping seemed die quietly without ceremony english became one indian languages english lost colonial stigma oddly enough around time hindu nationalists came power young indians new middle class think english skill like windows this hinglish hindi mixed english spreading encouraged flourishing private television channels supported advertisers newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace uninhibited hybrid hindi english popular idiom bazaar rushing ladder the purists naturally disapprove people comfortable accepting today indians relaxed confident people their minds become decolonized the world meanwhile also changed industrial information economy seemed speak india advantage symbolized success software business process outsourcing these bangalores given indians confidence reflect new social contract the new entrepreneurs inherit wealth risen back talent hard work professional skills a new emerged among urban youth need approval others especially west music composers like rehman display exuberant nonchalance new young bollywood pop stars so new fiction writers like arundhati roy designers fashion clothes beauty queens cricket stars some lessons neoclassical economic theory explains great deal indian economy stagnating first half 20th century went become one fastest growing end century it tells us example disgraceful protectionism governments years first half 20th century dampened world trade slowed world indian economies it also explains india performed world average thinking trade impoverished colonial period india closed economy denied fruits golden period world trade 1950 1970 license raj institutions nehru socialism also suppressed growth finally neoclassical economics explains dismantling controls integrating economy global economy indian economy become competitive growing rapidly reforms but whole story must turn institutions attitudes understand incentive structure indian indians blame colonialism impoverishing but seen colonialism complex tale for example india nationalists argued handloom textiles died india world technological obsolescence colonialism bigger damage loss indian confidence inhibited indian entrepreneurs this confidence began grow gandhi freedom movement first half 20th century industrialization pick however impact society insufficient create industrial revolution after independence india confidence certainly rose democracy took root flawed economic institutions nehruvian socialism acted damper once socialist institutions began replaced capitalist ones reform period returned indian marketplace today mood india opposite existed hundred years ago insecurity inferiority filled colonial india apparent writings bengali writers 19th century bankim chandra chatterji today writers like salman rushdie arundhati roy exhibit matter fact assuredness almost cool reflection changed national mindset india embraced democracy first capitalism afterwards made difference india became democracy 1950 universal suffrage extensive human rights 1991 opened free play market forces for rest world way around in west suffrage extended gradually last century mass political parties developed democracy began impinge capitalist institutions practices india democracy overwhelming majority poor voters 70 per cent still live rural areas organized labor constitutes less 10 per cent total labor middle class around 20 per cent population because democratic pressures india tried redistribute pie baked it set intricate regulatory networks private economy transformed rural industrial society it began think terms welfare jobs the result seen throttling enterprise slow growth missed opportunities it price india paid democracy rather much democracy enough capitalism since politics short run game growth long run one never situation completely optimal this explains indian politicians bother education results take long time come when politician promises rice two rupees kilo costs five rupees market wins election since politicians vigorously competed giving away free goods services voters when politicians money come creating schools improving old ones india damaging fiscal deficit around 10 percent gdp center states combined testimonial downside competitive politics teaches demand publicly provided goods services insatiable democracy but india problems governance go far beyond need appease interests the weakening democratic institutions since indira gandhi 1970s caused widespread corruption political violence populist giveaways paralysis problem solving conspicuously absent disciplined party organizations help leaders democracies mobilize support specific programs hence excessive reliance personal appeal individual leaders win elections when power leaders tend take easy way act will capitalism cousin globalization succeed establishing comfortable place india the answer depends ability deliver prosperity broadly it also depends leaders government business champion classic liberal premises free trade competition it needs leaders come say 1 people fare well competitive market place 2 winners far outnumber losers 2 capitalist democracy best arrangement found 4 globalization good thing great leap forward history my fear capitalism success india threatened much leftists protectionists timidity defenders the curious historic inversion democracy capitalism means india path future evolving daily dialogue conservative forces caste religion village leftist nehruvian socialist forces dominated intellectual life country 40 years new forces global capitalism these million negotiations democracy slow pace economic reforms also mean india might stable peaceful negotiated transition future say china it might also avoid deleterious side effects unprepared capitalist society russia although slower india likely preserve way life civilization diversity tolerance spirituality

vigorously and rajput thakurs never worked living shed feudal ways sake commercial opportunity moreover substantial india communities also stuck rut stagnation other asian countries equally backward

perspective hitler taught evil guy in germany well yet britain mostly whitewashed horrors committed teach kids continuing stuff imho raising awareness atrocities committed thats something i get behind i think tharoor main goal educate modern western masses harsher realities colonialism conveniently leave history text books this interesting counter narrative well das essentially wrote thing unbound but i think really contradicts tharoor claims everyone das arguments well corroborated partly responsible holding india back let brits go scott free yes individual entrepreneurial success stories benefited yes european institutions enabled industrial revolution yes caste system responsible but without indian structural head could changed things could enlightment historical colonial masters simply gave chance growth that carries lot culpability the drain theory definitely true the eic paying pounds crown since 1765 apart gifts parliament sourced india they took advantage aurgazeb tax exemption the marathas nawab awadh hyderabad nizam pay substantial amounts annually french eic well 1857 paid million rupees annually recognised nawab 1797 the point money could spent subjects institutions maybe would poor a book came last year called selling empire india making britain america demonstrates centrality india idea place making global british imperial system essentially new world discovered columbus searching riches india he makes argument american revolution east india company played visible disturbing role in view americans awareness company conquests india establishment authoritarian government evoked fear shared place indians americans corrupt despotic empire following revolution america connection india paradoxically expanded reflected part continuing appeal indian consumer fashions much however arose fortuitously extended british wars france 1794 onward neutral power united states well situated take advantage trading opportunities denied others by 1806 india contributed 4 percent imports americans commanded much continental european market indian goods it gave india almost hundered years peace i done i would call looting injustice peaceful have read whole thing the nehruvian disaster irrelevant judging british period taking information article i think still blame british letting india join industrial revolution this creating low in modern economy alone mean fail compete unstable political low confidence in uncertain future anyone invest time capital there mention low self confidence lack education reason indians moved toward industrialization and also mentioned indians money buy anything time then 1947 suddenly things could changed is things require time especially skills gained education i think generation indian educated enough 1980 automatically moved towards industrialization solely basis skills and course ca deny poor government policies i feel completely blaming right thing is something wrong i understood article saved later too long read right let sum the british many good things bad things personally i glad stuff like outlawing sati reforming personal laws i sure post independence governments would guts touch was india ever rich nation first place people use 27 world gdp stat justify label 27 world population also time both shashi tharoor gurcharan das starting flawed premise rich nation slightly topic i believe much tharoor british bashing shrewd political posturing when first ran parliament 2009 nair community voted en masse one us the class voted factor undersecretary general un erudite sophisticated etc he handily huge margin in 2014 lot older nairs voted bjp stand hindu values evidence anectodal everyone family voted tharoor 2009 parents generation voted bjp 2014 tharoor still vote margin order magnitude less compared 2009 a huge slide in 2019 faces prospect running suresh gopi popular actor current bjp rs mp stands real risk losing i consider stance attempt pandering nationalistic crowd it really simplistic claim britain looted us caused millions deaths due famine without considering much india wealth concentrated hands zamindars nawabs rajas taking account lives lost wars various kingdoms city states dotted indian british brought together well tharoor completely wrong either india rich maybe rich whatsapp forwards mention like 27 world gdp crap i also believe tharoor fans little bit exaggerating debates speeches i think going use wave false patriotism around makes people patriots social media advantage next elections i mean one really discusses robbery overall good thing even help turn someone life around positive way the older generation fears young whose minds decolonised confident adopting west material beliefs without fearing loss cosmological

entire post turned trolling so i reposting comment it starts historical background ends comparative description countries performed answer clothes shoes 1 historically models industrialisation followed two pathways steady where western advanced economies like usa uk undertook economic development tandem political development they begin universal franchise this helped fiscal economic development limiting initial demands state period capacity weak growth economic successes mostly east asia began authoritarian explicitly korea china de facto singapore thailand taiwan gave way political transformation degree economic success achieved 2 india india attempted economic development also granting universal franchise beginning the countries group botswana mauritius jamaica trinidad tobago costa rica perennial democracies at independence india one poorest nations regardless political system per capita gdp 617 ppp this implies the indian state ever burdened demands redistribution since early life leading poor state capacity see today healthcare education law enforcement there distrust private sector public capacity winding declaring bankruptcy plugging

price i create jobs india good start admins close thread i try divide reply two parts the first i reply points second i try write new parts touch slow steady western economies accelerated growth east asia this actually somewhat inaccurate as dani rodrik many others pointed one single path large economies ca rely fossil fuels tourism like trinidad tobago that path manufacturing growth most people mistakenly think east asian model uk germany france developed same true us manufacturing huge part us economy perhaps 1970s some people claim india ca replicate model two reasons the first limits employment opportunity the second slow i brief as far concerned lot people understand plenty jobs counted manufacturing past actually service sector jobs it factory back old days today everything lot jobs moved auxiliary services they get counted manufacturing today if job losses nearly bad made as concerned true world economy growing slower boom times historical perspective needed the average growth 1990s slower world economy growing right korea taiwan asian tigers well ireland eastern european nations poland slovakia etc rapid growth period despite generally low global growth so i think excuse really hold today yes opportunities lower 2000s historical perspective slightly average sadly focus cotton yarn exports at best fabrics niches like home textiles we able crack apparels segment our largest textile companies measured terms investment market cap yarn companies home fabrics companies in footwear could edge leather footwear beef ban thing could detterant original post good i would like point thailand bgl bangladesh malaysia indonesia east asia asean few points where western advanced economies like usa uk undertook economic development tandem political development they begin universal franchise semantic use term accurate enough plus timelines broad meaningless using broad terms one even say south korea developed slow western model changed system become developed the fact political development spectrum west like us esp end spectrum closer everyone else developed end basically one exists meaning one ever developed democracy and since democracies various types need provide context context provided things like universal suffrage basic easy metric india older proper democracy us manner used well like power holdings among rich homogeneous elites even despite voting rights as point india the fundamental reasons india followed general path leads development there universal model certain practices meaning de facto requirements things like infrastructure place set secondary tertiary sector like services r d this dynamic goes even beyond industrialization there development stability without infra development roads first things new empire build then time land reforms another prerequisite there plenty evidence countries developed 20th century everything else comes afterwards india accumulating factors exceptional things like democracy get go tertiary sector infrastructure land reform even done barring places like kerala its wonder things would smooth sailing and what india needs i different view india help people primary sector farmers that labor force help solve multiple problems problems like lack jobs everyone coming generations supposed enter job pool problems like enough capital major works become obsolete exclusive factories sound long term gambit problems like uprooting people country like india unique terms diversity already massive population density issues helping people agriculture sector biggest bang buck it helps bring hdi levels helps social security dynamic it helps balanced development people argument currently though proper model and views different india already things way it already exception it look new models growth instead relying ones may may really effective stage india no model universal fitted place implemented india look solutions novel unique situation currently though india seems picked model growth used majority world rapid growth fast tracked urbanization 10 years back indian urbanization rate less 20 reaching mid 30 to goes india ethos even practically sound india given unique spread population smaller area stressed natural resources when started make toys sold west never knew would become one like indian ways growing faulty considered new way we lot problems previous governments ignored gave lot importance early industrialization industrialization needs infrastructure skilled worker rule law missing india we pathetic infrastructure because government want anger people politicians huge interest infrastructure building could build everything quickly slow inefficient most people leave land easily the environment must protected the contractors also make lot money building everything slowly bad quality rural education bad condition most factory workers construction crew usually come rural areas in india unskilled difficult trained inefficient governance also another reason our state backward it takes days people get documents months companies bureaucrats usually work people unless someone attacks law enforcement also bad this post discussion brought fold gold i entire thread real quality discussion thanks everyone contributed discussion reading pleasure it disheartening comments many points ones political threads one area prime reforms job creation i feel agriculture i think india employing huge proportion population farming yet inefficient maybe latter cause former i think agriculture leveraged bring jobs rural areas bu investing rural infrastructure creation warehouses storage distribution transportation food processing this coupled building human resource capital rural areas teachers public transportation workers support personnels etc manufacturing main focus focus domestic oriented export oriented manufacturing where western advanced economies like usa uk undertook economic development tandem political development they begin universal franchise this helped fiscal economic development limiting initial demands state period capacity weak as far uk concerned period capacity weak become strong i think india unemployment problem it people want work

assault cases even get heard child abuse even faze indian public apparently child trafficking child marriages you try make fair argument basic idea religion shared belief moral it may sound like stating obvious difference moral believing to may small difference others for example filtering world conscience good inner voice what ever think try think certain positive way rather necessarily believing see feel situation how process world thus different the filter making random and might affect person sense feel less empathy care less especially one watching they might forget process things certain way language might also change emotions result well but also make things obscure dealing world religious say people believing good going make better especially one watching we also dealing lot benefits welfare happen morality people moment crisis custom believing good i understand the want make world better place freedom religion best hope trying change dynamics much another uncertainty for example guarantee security wealth people dealing circumstances may believing morality benefits presumably i think people want make world better place comes things improving people lives that technology and i think quite level technology quite easily say abandoning belief system better since even moral implies kind belief constitution make work tough times one watching for example almost every country dealing significant amount corruption less faith pretend faithful positive effects corruption ona global scale religion different the conversation regarding religion public generally involves people acting good at least act good still important imo there net benefit translate certain culture caring good action also psychological impact inclusive society rather one capitalistic dog eat dogs world i think rejecting belief good rather common sense common interests of good quickly shift human behavior unhealthy we also look humans savage without laws instructions their natural state quite barbaric point technology utopia important the barbaric humans past belief system even lives extreme use it took humans long time reach level society religion crutch good bad

religions believe religion means everyone something else thats completely fine i understand people accept people believe god believe nothing religion happens death also many things if born example muslim family muslim convert religion believe nothing i get hate judge people religious believe nothing accept my dad grew religious household religious but got older moved got married started lose belief possible change one belief i i believe god agnostic normally cut possibility one god multiple god i personally believe god i think could something death i believe i see already proven science still i think religions deserve get accepted respected i still get people hate judge others religion belief i nearly one hundred percent behind tiny little voice whispers bit bible fool sayeth heart god organised religion worth damn why ca allow people beliefs why cunt say anything religion im pushing peoples throats but atheist come say religion true science considered pushing beliefs throat thats hypocrisy relax dude religion belief i problem saying i believe forcing principles religion us fkin annoying while i strict atheist i still wonder religion necessary society a religion always fucks everyone core teaches moral code why people pay beggars do feel morally obliged religion even creates jobs tourism main industry a religion also great tool keep masses checks how many politicians make religion chief propaganda india population billion but since majority believes religion sincere moral code followed even lowest ranks society and reason god forgive us otherwise thus i think religion need reformation modernization the main thing religions need burn texts those unscientific teachings completely make every follower irrational then needs purge dhongis there genuine religious heads teach right conduct instead donation account numbers and stop mixing politics religion that worst thing happen religion bad many ways political leaders go lengths appease people and frankly somehow people always eager listen irrational things religions remember glorious tales ramayana mahabharta people want listen helps escape reality people believe people necessarily ideals institutions therefore religions inevitable but genuine leaders make religions good the masses believe facts believe want believe the thing missing scientific revolution began years ago means science archaic current texts no mention see universe you lost faith people deleted only india money also evil its actually root evil it power politician religious groups money also divides us fuck money i open criticism however religion brought us nothing hardship mass murder i agree thoroughly lot points made obviously quite passionately however sum net worth religion society mass murder hardship quite juvenile quite frankly false science religion separate facets social lives personal individual all major world religions base beliefs pre existing human morals either give narrative incentive uphold traditional moral values i personally believe breakdown faith lack belief preexisting religious moral institution led rise nazism germany 1930s look left leave religion i genuinely hope passionate rhetoric rather truly believe any religion country would morally bankrupt freedom expression freedom speech essential working democracy the passionate rhetoric reverse would condemned media crude conversion tactics obviously government secular religion never checked government forms college applications i definetly pissed people but rather shouting slogans holding stance need genuine discourse you start believing experience real paranormal things true as canadian i feel right opinion criticising people believing something agree who cares person believes one thing accept differences move at end day human do judge belief hmmm when say evil world assume good by standard different good evil if matter evil good to objective moral law moral law giver let start saying humans always looking idols this idol representation person it politician teacher anything indian teens often look bollywood celebrities cricketers idols therefore human tendency look idols however idols human when humans make mistakes idol breaks in comparison human idol idols god best alternative they represent perfection never break this gods believed never make mistakes always provide best path life that people blindly believe now clear i wan na say want break religion today possible you truly break idols however i guarantee something pop next years it mainstream religion like today science turn religion possibly discover fundamental truth become arrogant forget look perspectives except laws physics the reason permanent existence religion blind faith people source order society in 12 rules for life jordan peterson peterson brings compelling argument world possibly universe forms this true meaning chinese philosophical concept yin yang the popular symbol two white black fishes the white represents order hierarchy cultures discipline faith traditions black represents disorder freedom innovation creativity disorder chaos unpredictability what interesting see duality around i definitely recommend read book note sides model positive negative impacts so basically ideal society one balance but historically you observe whole human race making radical shifts one state another when many wars morality people new religion arises attempts create peace asserting codes people adhere this shift towards order however time rules grow become overpowering extent religion may appear oppression tyranny then society rebel rallies breaks religion restoring freedom free speech to rebel takes away existing rules but time new freedom people lose moral codes they take advantage freedom whole free society turns blunder the point religion anything world good bad in perspective promote hate religion difference religious people convey feelings atheists heathens you equally ignorant i completely agree religion many innocents suffer however i believe true religion religion today become tool politicians sway public support least india there riots arsons violent crimes rapes torture many atrocities committed defending religion there also spiritual babas teach ways ignorance bigotry the problem arises people feel religion told to godamn retard tell religion religious knowledge spiritual knowledge actually arises within you sense soul a guru helps recognizing a soul consciousness may meaningless i respect opinion to exploration soul aesthetic worth i believe i religious person i hindu yet religion taking force hate religions rather i quite fascinated sufism dream go nizamuddin dargah religion make feel i matter god come help misery while religious i admire

something else exists necessarily words whose nature guarantees exists to avicenna points since contingent thing merit could either exist exist must external cause made exist like tipping scales favor existence rather so take instance i contingent meaning i sort thing could easily failed exist in fact one time i yet exist future i cease existing proves i necessary so must cause maybe parents brought existence now avicenna observes aggregate whole contingent things words physical universe also contingent after everything universe contingent taken together one thing must contingent thus also needs external cause like i since external cause outside whole aggregate contingent things contingent so necessary hey presto proven necessary existent causes things and course god i think place

set base need find sufficient water essential minerals also check extract rocket fuel transport earth for isro along first step sending landers rovers deep space missions like mars sending rovers landers moon relatively cheap compared mars fails so step step edit thank kind stranger first silver edit why need deep space exploration because big universe much energy resources we fighting limited energy resources could tap energy resources whole universe including sun building dyson sphere unlimited clean energy then climate change problem everything solved instance we already technology

india software engineering it like good career choice i fresher got placed college working around 2 months wtf people obsession field it field earning lot boss even job respectful even years become project manager may earn lpa still like rich like whatever want still blind office timing like take vacation whenever want also one important factors health gon na deteoriate 9 hours front computer 3 hours traffic 5 days week wait weekends complete sleep also technology changes know learn technology career takes hit i get obsession behind computer science field parents put children and proud like proud child sitting front computer 9 hours work like slave,it might interests things included better job nearly everything else right graduation in jobs engineering otherwise sit front computer 9 hours take vacation want even come close earning software engineer earns it also one field get jobs right college you say doctors everyone memorization capacity dedication amount time money required one the alternatives business working freelancer contract basis in first boss take vacations end worrying business also need substantial capital start one startups fail the second option freelancer unstable one indian parents concerned job stability finding suitable wedding match software engineering takes prime spot unless mba course hey one doubt i became project manager get kahan complaint karoon i hear saying i work around technology completely temporary nature skills often start learn skills technology makes really stressed i want kids understand bit tech i know i want career assuming op right fucking professions earning lpa possible years 1 ca 2 politician sure legally though 3 own business 4 actor least tv show lead 5 doctor 6 cricket there maybe let look first now compare contacts influence money luck importantly time required moderately well fields compared engineering hence confirmed op trying edgy it field earning lot wrong maybe earning enough your compensation depends negotiation skills technical skills boss in job boss fresher job respectful wrong maybe job respectful project others years become project manager may earn lpa i know people earn much become pm may earn lpa still like rich like whatever want wrong poor money management investment skills still blind office timing wrong you work shitty company like take vacation whenever want wrong you work shitty company also one important factors health gon na deteoriate wrong that every job know take care 9 hours front computer wrong 3 hours traffic wrong not every city bangalore even bangalore everyone spends 3 hours traffic wait weekends complete sleep wrong poor time management skill part also technology changes know learn technology wrong fundamentals always remain career takes hit i get yes if good fundamentals obsession behind computer science field parents put children maybe parents everyone parents and proud ask parents child sitting front computer 9 hours work like slave sit front computer 9 hours and work like slave self so good career choice i engineer got degree one best engineering college india i working hard last 5 years i buy jio net pack without asking money family this success looks fuck i wish i made effort school landed engineer the path success if wan na hit certain milestones life financial engineering quickest engineering provided better platform us middle class folks secure settled life which aspiration middle class because scope apprenticeship education like these professions looked upon we indians despise work hands blue collar jobs as result two professional lines open since engineering cheaper degree 4 years lacs opposed mbbs 1 year 15 lacs students opt lol it excellent career option but need competent competitive one things india natural progression education school plus2 masters the number students try think number parents allow wards think pretty there also factor many students getting good mentor get different direction least get enough knowledge options in terms work someone said almost every profession nowadays demands spend time front computer this applicable sales field factory really unskilled labor anywhere educated position even managerial level factory necessarily end spending lot time front computer lot documentation reporting work least i think essence get job interests excites mind addition try get good remuneration support family whoever required along the demonization engineering stem studies incredible engineering hard good jobs india scarce the main problem everyone good engineer then people capable good engineering despise does mean engineering jobs bad perhaps bad company bad job good company if attitude interest engineering quit right way mba mba jobs require soft skills hard skills bull shit away even interested the fact think becoming project manager 8 years started career shows interest fun part engineering so i think much better train project management mba but think engineering fun aptitude sky limit immigration never easier also great companies india depending interest if looking money better selling soaps chocolates fcmg the typical it companies even worst working conditions offer much better industries good possibility immigrate find great indian company help find satisfying job please stop demotivating others rants problem 2 months work ex people years work ex make lakhs unless 8 year work ex guys coming office another reality check soon lpm 10 years sure like smoke whatever smoking shitting it new fad amongst millennials like shitting chetan baghat it good career choice wow what else like told aspects questions wrong it hugely responsible providing parity middle classes rural india fact earning lpa whilst working 9 hour day job sounds pretty awesome someone grew middle class mediocrity i sorry life experiences pretty different privilege born circumstances money important i need help guys i currently 3 options choose one i go if i engineering college mechanical engineering civil engineering computer engineering i passionate either i anyone without problem i work hard get degree easily i want field safe future guarantees decent job decent salary which one i prioritize first least any advice appreciated this post ignorance finest engineering key profession building economy top bottom when india looking modernize infrastructure economy need ed lot engineers they 2 options bring engineers outside train bunch locally chose while india seen improvements across board infrastructure economic growth trained engineers need bit glut engineers with supply demand works average wage engineers fallen the us seeing something similar health care as baby boomer generation dies smaller number gen x filling hospitals assisted living facilities built boomers now facilities starting close glut doctors nurses wages falling people earn much entire career much strenuous physical labour if earning much places afford live near office drastically cutting commutation time as health depends individuals initiative lifestyle whether earning 0 crores always risk losing everything as said years might earn if one talented ready keep learning forever limit plus slightly easier get field indian education system demands ideal 1 memory oriented teaching studying exam taking 2 hard learn given decent effort 3 4 demand market greater chance getting kind job degree 5 enables wider variety careers alternatives 6 minor good visas demanding 4 years undergrad education etc courses 3 years creates problems visas enables 7 colleges charge decent great money courses investment setting college acquiring accreditation etc reasonable compared setting medical college say b kind cash flow positive business model though recently glut colleges killed engineering taught india ticks boxes and fair given rest education system fares engineering decent default typical unfocused student choose it easy way earn decent salary furthermore modestly successful engineer programmer take ton innate talent you might something special get program people going profession ordinary folks lot pressure behind there ways succeed i think indian parents steer kids away stable certain surefire routes success the dynamic exists parts world being programmer better way ensuring upwards movement anthropologist historian radio host if poor background probably less inclined take risks comes career choice versus passion the holds true parents come background remember living poor like most indians recently even many class people come old money likely parents struggled financially raising so place obsessed status india trend go secure money way preserves social standing there cultural component mixed together i know lot migrants united states for money status interchangeable so see lot russian tatar guys brag basically education earn much doctors trucking businesses taxi companies a lot pretty miserable though live make money indians shit except see income equal guy drives truck earns 1 crore per year looked upon disdain versus programmer makes lpm but indians outlook makes scoff pursuit worthless even fulfilling based passion genuinely contributes country community i know many people studied subjects like history sociology anthropology they smart people got good phd programs overseas earning average engineer india ever but path riskier sociology student still chance getting program furthermore people go route basically required get doctorate ever want shot earning sustainable salary in country getting job right campus challenge engineering offering i saying all engineers get placed but easier get placed average engineer average xyz stream person it field earning lot boss even job respectful even years become project manager may earn lpa engineers start 3lpa jobs automated and grow rate every year for basic skillset right amount most jobs fields also start like first make 8 years unless started that less i wonder world living profession imagine pay mass people do tell startup business require lot fund start risky very startups businesses make good money still like rich like whatever want still blind office timing like take vacation whenever want this holds good fields and software engineering get freelancing give option not case many fields 9 hours front computer that if feel much switch not jobs like a lot jobs give work home options flexible hours more ever startup culture kicking you expected finish certain tasks nobody bothering deadline in newer companies even allowed pick tasks want todo board set deadlines work if freedom idk technology changes know learn technology career takes hit literally every profession if ca learn comply gst career takes hit if teacher learn teach today syllabus career takes hit if agriculturist employ modern methods career takes hit but honest read hackernews shit say technology x dead taken pinch salt the industry still requirements php funeral performed every day people internet so someone learnt php 2000s decided learn anything else mean jobless today and years enough time progress management so also valid reason simply even 40th 400th best engineer around would still get paid if 40th business industry end dead it quite practical indian parents push children in india people decide life complete engineering unknown behencho i mad i never knew job would gotten 5 lakhs per month 10 years one reason i think flexible whatever want engineering degree degrees options become limited please to frank seem like bad option india i know perfect life maybe wanted life not everyone become highly successful person photography acting singing etc at least it job option pursue passion relatively less risky job ample opportunities india it actually one best options it good career choice since 90s now decline career trends take time change got pakoda bijness promotor 60lpa years average service it companies like tcs wipro infosys etc even possible when start i doubt reach 60 10 years average indian it company hmm many people got butthurt post i guess years become project manager may earn lpa it may due like kind like chasing achhe din as soon i get home i make write basically every parents think engineering jobs easy get made study later realise shity one courage face kids kids whose time wasted if unlucky born family know engineer fucked my parents still things electric engineering repairs bulbs fixes wires i passed private engineering college working pwd contractor my parents wanted study get government civil engineering job lol i earn 20k per month might sound low let tell perks work site rs 20 commute home i get around 100 per day travel i leave home 10 get home around 4 pm my work managing field bill work pwd office 5 min walking home i zero expenditure i would like point engineering jobs give good salary per indian standards global level one lowest salary engineering job the reason companies come india search cheap employees in experience i projects i worked european engineers we job big pay gap now i get countries high living standards hence pay gap justified but since qualification job highlights indian engineers earn entrepreneurship freelancing i followed i written job free 2 years edit so i would suggest seriously consider entrepreneurship engineering mainly professions redirected india take example pf pharmacy get prescription drugs narcs also antibiotics anywhere without consequences also get work dream absolutely powerful i love i living nothing else safe where project managers earn lakhs if go societal norms failure 1 engineer 2 doctor 3 entrepreneur 4 government servant did miss regardless fuck societal norms india many engineers even overseas india infrastructure shit poor country means things need built implemented parents push kids look opportunities build stuff rich country english major still make kick ass money why post tagged travel it indian way doctors miserable workdays compulsory deployment still promoted i would want lakh rich person anything else

price i create jobs india good start admins close thread i try divide reply two parts the first i reply points second i try write new parts touch slow steady western economies accelerated growth east asia this actually somewhat inaccurate as dani rodrik many others pointed one single path large economies ca rely fossil fuels tourism like trinidad tobago that path manufacturing growth most people mistakenly think east asian model uk germany france developed same true us manufacturing huge part us economy perhaps 1970s some people claim india ca replicate model two reasons the first limits employment opportunity the second slow i brief as far concerned lot people understand plenty jobs counted manufacturing past actually service sector jobs it factory back old days today everything lot jobs moved auxiliary services they get counted manufacturing today if job losses nearly bad made as concerned true world economy growing slower boom times historical perspective needed the average growth 1990s slower world economy growing right korea taiwan asian tigers well ireland eastern european nations poland slovakia etc rapid growth period despite generally low global growth so i think excuse really hold today yes opportunities lower 2000s historical perspective slightly average sadly focus cotton yarn exports at best fabrics niches like home textiles we able crack apparels segment our largest textile companies measured terms investment market cap yarn companies home fabrics companies in footwear could edge leather footwear beef ban thing could detterant original post good i would like point thailand bgl bangladesh malaysia indonesia east asia asean few points where western advanced economies like usa uk undertook economic development tandem political development they begin universal franchise semantic use term accurate enough plus timelines broad meaningless using broad terms one even say south korea developed slow western model changed system become developed the fact political development spectrum west like us esp end spectrum closer everyone else developed end basically one exists meaning one ever developed democracy and since democracies various types need provide context context provided things like universal suffrage basic easy metric india older proper democracy us manner used well like power holdings among rich homogeneous elites even despite voting rights as point india the fundamental reasons india followed general path leads development there universal model certain practices meaning de facto requirements things like infrastructure place set secondary tertiary sector like services r d this dynamic goes even beyond industrialization there development stability without infra development roads first things new empire build then time land reforms another prerequisite there plenty evidence countries developed 20th century everything else comes afterwards india accumulating factors exceptional things like democracy get go tertiary sector infrastructure land reform even done barring places like kerala its wonder things would smooth sailing and what india needs i different view india help people primary sector farmers that labor force help solve multiple problems problems like lack jobs everyone coming generations supposed enter job pool problems like enough capital major works become obsolete exclusive factories sound long term gambit problems like uprooting people country like india unique terms diversity already massive population density issues helping people agriculture sector biggest bang buck it helps bring hdi levels helps social security dynamic it helps balanced development people argument currently though proper model and views different india already things way it already exception it look new models growth instead relying ones may may really effective stage india no model universal fitted place implemented india look solutions novel unique situation currently though india seems picked model growth used majority world rapid growth fast tracked urbanization 10 years back indian urbanization rate less 20 reaching mid 30 to goes india ethos even practically sound india given unique spread population smaller area stressed natural resources when started make toys sold west never knew would become one like indian ways growing faulty considered new way we lot problems previous governments ignored gave lot importance early industrialization industrialization needs infrastructure skilled worker rule law missing india we pathetic infrastructure because government want anger people politicians huge interest infrastructure building could build everything quickly slow inefficient most people leave land easily the environment must protected the contractors also make lot money building everything slowly bad quality rural education bad condition most factory workers construction crew usually come rural areas in india unskilled difficult trained inefficient governance also another reason our state backward it takes days people get documents months companies bureaucrats usually work people unless someone attacks law enforcement also bad this post discussion brought fold gold i entire thread real quality discussion thanks everyone contributed discussion reading pleasure it disheartening comments many points ones political threads one area prime reforms job creation i feel agriculture i think india employing huge proportion population farming yet inefficient maybe latter cause former i think agriculture leveraged bring jobs rural areas bu investing rural infrastructure creation warehouses storage distribution transportation food processing this coupled building human resource capital rural areas teachers public transportation workers support personnels etc manufacturing main focus focus domestic oriented export oriented manufacturing where western advanced economies like usa uk undertook economic development tandem political development they begin universal franchise this helped fiscal economic development limiting initial demands state period capacity weak as far uk concerned period capacity weak become strong i think india unemployment problem it people want work

caa misused caa unconstitutional the core idea make easier undocumented immigrants afghanistan bangladesh pakistan get indian citizenship the catch immigrants muslims are really persecuted minorities would benefit legislation yes individuals precise this revealed government hearing parliamentary committee 2016 version bill the committee asked many people would benefit legislation the intelligence bureau replied but specifically excluding muslims jews bill raised justified concerns modi government trying enshrine religious discrimination law this article 14 india constitution prohibits

religion race caste sex place birth the opposition mps pointed amit shah insisted exception article 14 reasonable classification making laws in simple words state discriminate citizens grounds special benefits offered eg reservations marginalised communities this matter whether reasonable classification justified act contended courts decided later b how caa misused caa amended parliamentary

nothing concrete far determined since nation wide bill drafted but one thing know sure every person resident india required prove citizenship how one prove citizenship this matters get complex if consider speculated ancestry provision may may included nation wide nrc the current law citizenship follows the citizenship act defines citizen section 3 citizenship birth 1 except provided 2 every

indian citizens citizen if born 2003 parents indian citizens one parents indian citizen illegal immigrant citizen so born 1987 indian citizen birth if born 1987 prove parents indian citizens what orphans how if born 1987 prove citizenship provision birth certificate documents may prescribed nrc assuming parents educated organised enough would able preserve birth certificate documents people lower middle class slightly privileged backgrounds may done educated informed enough importance documents this leaves person state handicap if born 1987 considering almost 44 india population 24 years age total 85 population 54 years age safely conclude group constitutes large chunk india population you prove least one parents indian citizen so born 1987 naturally parents born 1987 you provide necessary documents your parents prove they re indian citizens basically expect preserve possess documents dating back much 1960 many news agencies reporting mere submitting passports aadhar cards

economic cost the global economy slowdown india exception i generally never attribute gdp numbers government since active participation government gdp via public expenditure still crucial however government actively makes policies detrimental state economy fingers pointed this case nrc in assam alone cost 1220 crores 1500 crores ended massive failure source the national cost implementing nrc would run lakhs crores with indian economy current situation implementing nrc would surely leave visible dent indian economy especially absence roi return investment policy the estimated cost might close lakh crores unverified source this opinion piece figures may effect inflated underestimated say costs 3 lakh crores still last year gdp trillion however like demonetisation act bring country halt people line yet verification centres document verification follow ups enquiries in assam nrc updating started july 30 2018 ended august 31 2019 despite taking year complete process entire process

minority communities hindus sikhs buddhists jains parsis christians afghanistan bangladesh pakistan erroneously giving benefit indian citizenship immigrants usually net economic benefit costs type i errors confined national security these costs nationwide typically limited handful border districts india type ii errors false negatives these occur qualify indian citizens mistakenly categorized illegal immigrants a nationwide nrc similar one assam would imply false negatives get sent detention centres deported type ii errors extremely costly to minimize false negatives bar qualify citizen simple easily identifiable also infrastructure scrutinize paperwork nrc exceptionally efficient the indian state usually fails counts given cab current religious exclusionary basis muslims higher risk exclusion false negatives though groups including hindus likely affected errors there three main issues consider the first type i type ii errors if avoid false positives government high level scrutiny nrc inclusion individuals burden meeting higher bar in process might mistakenly excluded on hand bar set low prevent false negatives erroneous exclusions illegal immigrants may slip cracks the current

hinduism people would sided liberals side bjp respect hinduism however superficial may you read article https details islamophobia you playing right bjp hands using term bjp use uno reverse card label hinduphobic can not defeat hindu identity politics appealing secularism constitution ad nauseam you create political liberal hindu identity opposition bigoted one market masses that way see hindutva going in summary 1 bjp wants change india hindu rashtra 2 muslims christians dalits people take constitution secularism seriously oppose 3 hence bjp hiding intentions change people perceptions normalize hindutva even normalized currently 4 so justify fascism by creating conditions necessary justification 5 muslims protesting streets portrayed want india become islamic state 6 students seen supporting pakistan jihadis hence want break india pieces 7 intellectuals urban naxals maybe even supporting china 8 slurs merely slurs taken seriously become actual accusations perhaps legal

ezhuthiyikk karyamilla meaning for only low caste people expletive benefit examinations wo get benefit another thing i noticed people getting crazy religion especially hindus they feel one else

india ok i dalit i trying learn history dalits long time although written seems like dominant narrative i think truth could much sinister in tn i live dalit communities ancient times still lived outside agricultural societies but several cultural practices would turn idea dalits looked upon several rituals marriages temple functions etc respectable role members castes receive blessings some temple festivals start first ritual performed member pariayar community then sangam poetry puts paraiyar community one noble communities so lot missing but looking recent results cultural practices past it possible shift religious practices resulted dehumanization dalits dalits likely descendants tribals lived periphery cities they lived separate settlements culturally and definitely mixing absence caste system and lived peacefully becacuse post ivc agricultural societies knew descended societies gods sivan murugan the shift sanskritisation tamil culture arrival brahmins i think brahmins integrated tamil culture okay adopting local traditions this could one cause schisms exist iyers iyengars tn the beginning caste system sanskritization tn culture would pushed dalits outside tamil society power struggle cultural space tamils brahmins winning today still remnants struggle lot old kula deivam temples employ dalits priests tradition so yea last 1500 years condition dalits

6,help how i stop dad squandering away savings,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,my dad retired 2 years back government organization pension scheme he saved 25l years sustain he thoughts opening playschool wanted something education noble idea yes but background etc understanding schools run more importantly problem dad unfortunately lacks business acumen trusting people he tried franchise one company signed contract lost 1l company refused return this done without much consultation i could least tried look prevent next aligned another school took franchise spent 8l till date running significant loss i also 2 elder brothers supportive terms finance else we living different cities mumbai i delhi parents up my step school coordinator initially found teaching gig right step imo elsewhere soonafter year date 5 children 2 teachers mostly sit whole day my dad acts school coordinator situation lately argues open school home using part building rented school run rented building he also expects support financially despite multitude warnings ignoring number suggestions i made etc to put cherry cake i came across profile experienced school coordinator i suggested dad lead rejected muslim something i expected dad another story my concern stems fact deep hole dad sinking terms expenses this worrying i started job 2 years back expect least years i position i help bit additionally current tenant pretty good offers recurring cashflow terms savings my take wants focus education simply open scholarship scheme suppport decent schools underpriviliged kids while upside financially amount fixed far better use money imo dad burning money educational venture how i stop,get trusted relative close friend ask explain said father i mean get someone true dad someone father listens your dad reason opening school gain social influence among peers community i think stop madness starved savings if concerned kids would funded underprivileged children education rather starting school just make sure start contacting european women i understand you dad wants start school or want teach each different adventures have tried find motivating start school show examples risk associated running play school especially legal risk could deterrent assume options financial medical expenses highlight considering father considerable expertise field govt sector redirect start consulting firm core area expertise there still area experience matters especially govt do support financially right enabling besides goes broke one turn show mota bhais photo to honest sounds like wo listen i would suggest 1 try talk using numbers charts someone suggested 2 speak brothers get understand financial risk get commit supporting dad loses savings 3 work speak sternly dad tell limit money give burns prepare everyone get pissed unfortunately financial future stake everyone going throw kulcha face be prepared become big stink lose money support rest life anyway but least would tried tell siblings told ask give 40 income looking if dad wants open professional school take see one govt job up may different expectations work functioning one would give context feel entire project instead stubbornly dithering dark if dad wants prestige thinks deserves cause govt job didnt get retirement trying manufacture said throwing money around abandon ship he come terms fact time throw money around passed i think two things either convince dad reduce liquidity your mother tried talk what stand can convince father put least money name non flexible instruments like nsc ppf tax free bonds gold small peice land would helpful visit financial counselor point little 25 lakh spend retired life would good idea convince associated educational institute couple years learn tricks trade would willing associated ngo works field education can try talk engage people tried education business failed if everything fails i think make clear support financially whether choice make future tread carefully last one it surely break heart you also risk loose inheritance i hoping give shock may consider ask take full teaching job govt school no risk impart knowledge earn pocket change keeps occupied let burn dependable ruin life witb many i told on serious note play school good venture put money currently gon na br hard push towards profit needs lot effort so slowly research shift dads house buy share 50 partner talk like businessman tell would handle then hire coordinator give dad share tell relax but make sure someone dad listens passes dad seems one people never listen kids this general issue indian parents they raise children investments expect returns children become capable else get labelled aulaad society they care saving future get money runs since always going things get hard it one pitfalls rather individualistic culture discussion another day i brother going set financially i awesome job amazing pay brother good college generally pretty good however i already warned parents see us investments generate returns rather save retirement i still going help things get bad wo managed money poorly as result started saving investing money speculating real estate anymore i think also need ask think survive saving runs if plan good if make clear wo help got mouth full bad economy make this very very clear he needs fucking adraid if still manages get bad spot financially due external factors help obviously but stop squandering money if wants nobel wants help tell teach people home free volunteer free school ngo nearby there lot help people time rather money why op quit job help enterprising dad you lucky dad entrepreneurial spirit bc help reach goal this major problem indian society

6,the impact gst invoicing thus revenue profit organizations operating india exploring one factors impacting economy right,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,tl dr because gst organizations bill clients state involved gst norms if gst required one bill means multiple bills depending number states involved it could go high 36 bills 29 states 7 union territories this means x effort required make 100 rupees requires effort 1 36 make 100 rupees meaning work required make amount money increased 100 3500 this impacted profit companies thus economy x200b x200b x200b x200b before i begin i expert taxation i business guy working b2b sales indian mnc my year career largely i experienced era well i constantly deal gst numerous requirements my objective highlight major roadblock i many business folks encountered due gst i feel aspect playing big role slowdown time left largely unexplored till grassroot nature problem the people higher encounter directly anyone encounter would understand gravity problem aka reporters etc again reiterate i trying debate improvements vat i merely highlight side gst hindering revenue profit thus business x200b let start basic concepts first invoicing the act giving products services utilized customer for people simple receipt end meal instance checkout counter clothing store clothes purchased bill given cleaning service cleaning homes but organization invoice means collect money client anything sold client generate invoice products rendered the invoice also tax details gst number billing address registered address shipping address list items need paid applicable tax cgst igst sgst payment due date authorized signatures invoice means collect cash client without proper invoice cash collected this problem starts since invoice gives lot ground client delay payment x200b the process invoicing invoicing function organization once product delivered services rendered sometimes delivered invoicing triggered meaning generated money collected client this usually done erp like sap oracle the invoice reaches collections department collection manager submits invoice client verification payment collection managers front line people tasked bringing money organization they one important people running business performance impacts cash flow organization they normally tagged accounts aka clients one collection manager could handling anywhere one client thousands depending nature size clients client verifies invoice money transferred selling organization becomes revenue subsequently profit client holds invoice reason becomes lost revenue bad debt loss selling organization the longer client holds money lesser value money holds due concept money 100 rupees today considered money 100 rupees one month due money thus delayed payment impacts profitability organization gst services industry gst dictates invoicing services done state services delivered explain concept detail crux problem to start i outline simple sale sale would translate era statement assume tata motors intend buy 5000 chairs offices pepperfry 50 lakh rupees tata motors also wants pepperfry install chairs offices 5 lakh rupees provide 5 years warranty including checkup every year determine life chair repairs required 15 lakh rupees tata motors wants chairs delivered 50 offices india across 20 different states this mix products chairs services installation maintenance the total bill 70 lakh rupees 5000 chairs inr 50 lakhs installation chairs 50 offices across 20 states inr 5 lakhs maintenance chairs 5 years inr 15 lakhs pepperfry sales executives take purchase order tata motors put order system the input purcahse order trigger three functions delivery products services b invoicing payment order c service maintenance invoicing before gst came picture bill would generated pepperfry single bill centrally ie would generate bill 70 lakhs extra relevant vat tax details two organizations this would single entire deal irrespective state city etc they would give tata motors one single piece paper saying owed 70 lakhs due date payment manoj pepperfrys collection manager tata motors submit single invoice tata motors office checked tata motors procurement finance teams nothing wrong invoice payment cleared due date point focus one invoice needed delivery chairs services entire country manoj submit one invoice follow invoice collect payment one invoice tata motors teams verify one invoice process payment one invoice only one tax number billing address needed invoice done centrally if something wrong invoice manoj correct one invoice resubmit tata motors x200b invoicing like i mentioned gst dictates invoicing done state services delivered ie separate gst filing states explaining means separate invoice generated state involved transaction if one state involved one invoice if two states involved two invoices if five states involved five invoices and case since twenty states involved twenty invoices x200b the values invoices split direct proportion usage if 100 rs total bill value three states maharashtra up kerala usage bills maharashtra 60 up 30 kerala 10 so sense separate company state terms gst implication tata motors pepperfry transaction since chairs delivered 20 states tata motors pepperfry registered office twenty states along gst number state tata motors issue 20 purchase orders proportionate value pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally 20 states the sales executive enter twenty purchase orders system then deliveries triggered 20 states 20 different invoices handed manoj generation manoj submit 20 invoices pepperfry whose procurement department verify 20 invoices give finance verify initiate 20 payments then 20 payments received tata motors 20 banking transaction id manoj verify 20 payments close transaction ideal scenario as might able tell effort required everyone involved deal gone 20 times this effort required one state involved buying side ie maharastra selling maharashtra it twice effort two states involved buying side ie maharashtra selling up kerala possibility going upto 36 time effort required previously amount money since 29 states 7 union territories yes union territories treated separately well x200b impact pepperfry still going make 70 lakhs deal effort required twenty times tata motors give 20 purchase orders 20 invoices generated the time taken process invoices value impact time taken collect money this invoice template values different example maharashtra chairs inr 5 lakhs installation inr 50k support inr lakhs kerala chairs inr 3 lakhs installation inr 30k support inr 90k up chairs inr 10 lakhs installation inr 1 lakh support inr 3 lakhs the total money collected sales executive manoj procurement guy finance guy 20 times work added value their efficiency scenario gone 5 arguably go states union territories involved although rare case also like i said ideal scenario it always go smoothly some challenges encountered incorrect proportions purchase orders invoices someone made mistake 10 needed allocated up allocated 11 15 the process repeated finding fault b incorrect gst po invoice suppose particular invoice wrong gst means ca processed incorrect tax information means money ca collected invoice before gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistakes happen real life this one common things face mistakes happened gst well happen multiples and really ca expect people make mistakes always again efficiency goes multiple times effort required fix mistakes c missing gst it necessary companies gst registration every state so tata motors might registered office 2 states example ie wo gst number they provide declaration pepperfry saying gst number two states pepperfry able give invoice the payment money delayed till getting declaration experience takes long time tata motors says able claim input tax credit state that like leaving money table getting declaration basically saying willing lose money transaction requires approvals upto highest levels loss company manoj follow two time consuming things get amount money thus efficiency goes cash flow cash lifeline company a company without cash survive they could valued billion dollars cash pay employees shut kingfisher could pay employees interest vendors cash left jet cash payment salaries fuel loan payments etc bsnl struggling pay things cash thus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company if companies people cash flow would oxygen invoicing cash brought company because decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduced collection cash so cash collected 25 days would taking say 45 days collection managers efficiency gone and tiny delays add incorrect gst add another 7 days cash collected missing gst add 15 days etc this two outcomes firstly pepperfry earlier predicted get money 30 days receiving 45 days means 70 lakhs need 30th day daily expenses needs found somewhere else since 70 days coming another 2 weeks they dip reserves 15 days secondly money lost value it 70 lakhs end 30 days since time passed lost value due time value money it could generated interest could invested delayed hence value lost this loss pepperfry to summarize delayed payment cycle company it takes longer collect amount money used gst introduced if money takes longer come takes longer go salaries interest payments vendor payments outflows impacted profit the profit made deal varies company company deal deal let us assume pepperfry made 10 profit deal ie 7 lakhs due following factors profit get impacted the payment cycle delayed collecting profit longer duration they collect 63 lakhs start making profit this could say collected 13 20 invoices the remaining 7 give profit so basically profit generation delayed cash flow delayed this means profit made deal lost value if 7 lakhs less 7 lakhs value due time value money and efficiency gone effort required generate amount profit gone thus profit deal actually gone b there 20 invoices process not always go many get stuck payment delayed may never come due process issues the money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt if invoice gets stuck reason like incorrect gst missing gst incorrect value cash wo collected invoice amount get reduced profit so invoice gotten processed 7 lakhs profit less say 5 lakhs if 7 lakhs collected deal pepperfry actually make loss deal the biggest culprits psu like hpcl bpcl ubi etc their requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice this payment could get delayed years thus profit deal impacted they wo pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reasons many businesses sell psu reason profits cash get stuck business this different earlier say mistake one invoice fix now could many for amount revenue chances wo make amount profit due lowered efficiency longer payment cycle stuck payments profit made gotten impacted x200b in conclusion ramblings due nature gst effort required make amount money era gone this impacted revenue thus profit made companies problems everyone face gst if want business multiple states ready face challenges feel free discuss impact economy in opinion big impact i really need someone much knowledgeable analyze publish i feel deserves conversation least one change impacted revenue profit extensively made making money harder thus going lasting impact economy the worst part look like system going change near future x200b i probably put tl dr later,that enlightening read thank detailed explanations examples so far i read handwavy statements like gst ivory tower economists voices ground like ones show reality this line particular surprised tata motors pepperfry registered office twenty states along gst number state it fcked govt expects service provider registered office every state client i know long i wanted justice issue i got tired writing lol i tried put many details possible explain anyone reads i know formatting fucked i fix later this good even occasional oversimplification you explained everything clearly having maintain gst registrations multiple states especially service companies service usually delivered internet without goods moving one state another huge pain one nation one tax ass yeah add 1 if raise invoice pay gst next month without fail whether collect payment 2 if sme constantly track whether seller filing sales get input tax purchases 3 make stupid bills every time send material state make sure invoice bureaucrats make rules paper flowcharts without experience earn single rupee life make us go bullshit someone work finance minister my ca telling government new regulation works use sarkari gst software upload invoices daily basis he said put effect yet but right sounds like disaster traders very informative post kind posts make reddit india worth browsing thanks listing imo gst single biggest reason behind current economic slowdown and listed one biggest reasons somehow taxation mca rquirements increased manifold modi regime called newspapers anywhere the left busy labelling modi whatnot arent willing go details actually wrong the problem started calling modi ki sarkar now cant even turn blame reality modi government effective taxation much possible all modi govt initiatives demo increased mca compliance gst angel tax results taxation dont get process making taxation effective dramatically increased compliance costs businessmen negatively impact economy modi govt actually leftists left would like admit and modi leftish shenanigans left reduced calling names rather criticise policy specifics i understand gst well i used run company past pre post gst era it still running i moved whenever client used raise invoice igst opposed split clients would simplify invoicing like head branch tata motors mumbai raising single invoice igst head branch pepperfry delhi as mentioned earlier i might got totally wrong i completely understand gst works large organizations operating multiple states working several vendors

slows significantly i personally know many young men pinning futures small job gulf trade unions must reigned ease business improve it wo happen overnight greatest thing current left government left government i really wish way return hometown as way i sustain current income i move back go freelance optimistic to fair govt investment social welfare without communist just look mamata banerjee bengal despite hating done good work mgnrega improving hospitals dismayl state overall improving rural infrastructure the fiscal deficit high debt mentioned common communist govt bengal when left left high debt lakh crore current govt anything either reign my main issue kerala model ca implemented anywhere else it works good need way lift states i like breaking big states smaller working likewise produce replicas goa decent social infrastructure well good enough ease business lift people one less spoken advantages kerala population either cities live close proximity cities i believe factors like high hdi low imr but regardless brought high development i think kerala model adopted rest states if looking emulate i guess tamil nadu model socialism proven successful tn may kerala often 2 3 counts again one advantage tn state like up madras prominent administration city since but i think benefits minimal moment radicalization problem islam i think rates radicalization kerala comparison equivalent muslim population number elsewhere do source while op raising legitimate points kerala economy seem missing whole point kerala model kerala model it achieved high material quality development indicators despite a low income state the reason called model unique pretty much everywhere else world economic growth quality life human development go strangely kerala managed improve material quality life little economic growth by arguing kerala economic growth track record may considered abysmal though fair point reinforcing concept kerala model nobody calls kerala economic miracle everybody knows is replicatable model maybe is key solving problems across country definitely seem like has historic circumstances contributed perhaps but historic geographic reasons also limits economic potential so argument cuts ways now would say facetious argue outcomes solely due gulf boom because impact gulf boom kerala really began late 80s kerala declared hundred percent literacy early 90s would possible without strong government policies years also places gulf nris malappuram actually backward areas kerala and give credit travancore royal family laughable case many regions southern tamil nadu today part erstwhile travancore kingdom while parts travancore kingdom kerala done extremely well parts tamil nadu yet catch also travancore kingdom probably covered less 30 modern kerala it clear significant government policy laid foundation transformation massive wealth redistribution program launched first kerala government communist government so kerla model achieved fewer children dying fewer mothers dying fewer illiterate people more people getting skilled hence able find higher paying jobs albeit elsewhere i would argue yet yield dividends kerala model so yes model is best model hard say has advantages oh yes definitely the riot cases high almost everything registered reported https one ridiculous things i ever heard games begin i think best things happened kerala progressive travancore state early communist government lots christian missionaries christian missionaries progressive travancore state meant state robust education system providing progressive good labor base development communist govt took land absentee landlords redistributed land among landless laborers also brought social parity working caste system social parity much prerequisite economic growth kerala achieved much earlier others state could take full advantage lead remittances headstart states early independence days 2 unemployment rate despite dependence remittances foreign jobs state unemployment rate level 5 making third highest country sikkim tripura true but like many others mentioned aversion blue collar work kerala it unavailability jobs it best feature happens emancipated societies this issue daily wage work seen societal perspective merits sustainability kerala model seems kerala thrashing anything else do see many merits mentioned kerala lot things going i rather anywhere else india but challenges well like state what malayalis gloat much better state india really look falling short the reality gulf money dries kerala fucked either produce capital expertise state leave beautiful homeland work possibly unfriendly places why much unemployment kerala deleted kerala started 47 literacy 1951 time up 12 average and 47 started 0 thanks kerala proclivity open mix cultures the various social reformation movements influx christian missionaries among many factors contributed who claimed govts the ems govt though made giant strides kerala education bill https post independence post independence unemployment rate despite dependence remittances foreign jobs state unemployment rate level 5 making third highest country sikkim tripura true but like many others mentioned aversion blue collar work kerala it unavailability jobs it best feature happens emancipated societies this issue daily wage work seen societal perspective political violence violence never good thing political violence slightly different political awareness among population generally considered prime metric considering collective intelligence societal emancipation region in kerala political awareness super high this often misused parties political killings like bjp rss spreading super low the political killings happen kerala always rss cpi m north kerala while highly condemnable exceedingly rare and also metrics reported recorded much stringently kerala thanks well functioning you might remember report scandinavia reported extreme high cases sexual assault similar situation though high influx migrants also problem hotbed isis recruitement this seems ridiculous almost right rss playbook quoting exact article quoted india muslim population third largest world far contributed negligible numbers isis fewer 90 people according estimates more gone britain even maldives india sure wahhabism growing threat kerala muslims seem drawn but absolute numbers abysmally small ca really considered metric and finally extreme dependence remittances remittances undeniably drive bulk kerala economy you provided good numbers sure what point though agriculture brain drain might flipsides comparing states depend agriculture better people employed abroad bringing money economy rather flail abject poverty it funding flourishing society malayalis built vast business empires abroad and employing thousands indians according logic it engineers flocking bangalore bad nation agriculture depend us offshore development projects kerala bunch

education age,i know multiple people mbas phds llb 30s 40s start consultancies various business related fields none practising lawyers course opened lot doors terms career opportunities it adds lot profile depending field trying enter benefits greatly finance investing startup entrepreneurship consulting imo great move luckily friend first year clat age limit supreme court made verdict said he might get used students half age lol on slightly different note such question would unthinkable developed country this one area i genuinely envious there prejudice age comes learning i hope go ahead studies we enough people actually willing study llb entrance exam iits law programs i llb around 10 yrs back practicing i classmate reason wanted learn very nice person fought traffic police car towed legal parking area traffic constable brought back car said sorry llb 3 years course holding graduation 5 years 12 pass attending classes compulsory good college one cares many others i 4 second year so attending evening full time consider college gets admitted while studying reading cases interesting practicing would mean spending many years zero low income many friend still makes less 10k month this top law school matters if graduate place getting good law firms get easy i believe everyone llb no matter helps know law du law admits people upto 30 years age not sure iit doesnt great rep though law school needs years establishment good faculties most ive heard iit law course teaching terrible if ample financial reserves form alternative property good option only india truly dedicate litigation without running money on hand think making money law entering age 36 likely disappointed easy quick money law transactional law drafting registering etc eg businessman negotiating team negotiate potential partner transactional practice well infact independent lawyers make money drafting agreements leave license rather appearing court you make k per month drafting rent agreements affidavits barely hope make 15 k per month fighting cases court even better known law firms mumbai offer freshers k starting salary an area litigation indeed profitable cornered niche profession firms few solicitor firms agree recruit someone 36 years age the best thing someone owns huge profitable independently practising law courts actually pleading court thats profession used india why age limit

year llb course we 5 year ba llb course bba llb course so shift another city 5 years go class everyday year olds ask give clat research colleges give llb degree alone for already graduate degree like ba bsc bba many factors need considered he feel age gap lot especially 5 year program also 3 year programs since many students join straight college the exception probably du glc mumbai the reason attendance issue du still evening batches these attract older candidates working day also upsc aspirants law back your friend find easier gel crowd places your friend might able continue working studying even teaching job part time those kind chill already working discrimination may low regarding placements hr recruiters want cheap workers baggage hence ageism crops law schools colleges matter factories unfortunately friend outlier he highly experienced diverse fields this bad good recruiters know get offer appropriate 21 year old it good finds job values experience mba etc takes lot hustling find yet explain 4 years unemployment truth classmates safer bets getting recruited formal placement process tough litigation stream always option it slow work beginning self employed small

actual devolution would 39 earlier became 42 even 3 increase visible neutralised centre the reality increased matching contribution states css done away 6000 model schools started 2011 half way took

untied transfers tied towards meeting additional commitment in revised pattern css put money you made commitment uncommit but changed pattern whatever untied funds got put schemes for example 2014

capitalism makes journey modernity unique explains good deal jawaharlal nehru planners trust private entrepreneurs made state entrepreneur surprisingly failed create industrial revolution instead india experienced agricultural revolution early 1970s it thus important industrial agricultural industrial eluded its investment rate also rose 6 percent well 20 per cent yet engender why i think

modest liberalization 1980s decisive turning point came july 1991 minority government narasimha rao announced sweeping reforms it opened economy foreign investment trade dismantled import controls

thinking trade impoverished colonial period india closed economy denied fruits golden period world trade 1950 1970 license raj institutions nehru socialism also suppressed growth finally neoclassical economics explains dismantling controls integrating economy global economy indian economy become competitive growing rapidly reforms but whole story must turn institutions attitudes understand

democracy first capitalism afterwards made difference india became democracy 1950 universal suffrage extensive human rights 1991 opened free play market forces for rest world way around in west suffrage extended gradually last century mass political parties developed democracy began impinge capitalist institutions practices india democracy overwhelming majority poor voters 70 per cent still live rural areas organized labor constitutes less 10 per cent total labor middle class around 20 per cent population because democratic pressures india tried redistribute pie baked it set intricate regulatory networks private economy transformed rural industrial society it began think terms welfare jobs the result seen throttling enterprise slow growth missed opportunities it price india paid democracy rather much democracy enough capitalism since politics short run game growth long run one never situation completely optimal this explains indian politicians bother education results take long time come when politician promises rice two rupees kilo costs five rupees market wins election since politicians vigorously competed giving away free goods services voters when politicians money come creating schools improving old ones india damaging fiscal deficit around 10 percent gdp center states combined testimonial downside competitive politics teaches demand publicly provided goods services insatiable democracy but india problems governance go far beyond need appease interests the weakening democratic institutions since indira gandhi 1970s caused widespread corruption political violence populist giveaways paralysis problem solving conspicuously absent disciplined party organizations help leaders democracies mobilize support specific programs hence excessive reliance personal appeal individual leaders win elections when power leaders tend take easy way act will capitalism cousin globalization succeed establishing comfortable place india the answer depends ability deliver

industrialization and also mentioned indians money buy anything time then 1947 suddenly things could changed is things require time especially skills gained education i think generation indian educated enough 1980 automatically moved towards industrialization solely basis skills and course ca deny poor government policies i feel completely blaming right thing is something wrong i understood

adopted intermittently many parts world across many companies recently found huge success japan microsoft https i think well known well documented reality times work balance life highly trash india work environments largely toxic due culmination many internal external factors the commute eats substantial time day folks well top are organizations india already implemented 4 day week plans pipeline companies what thoughts initiative anyone reckon succeed,the single biggest minus point indian society clear communication lack transparency accountability dealing things such case 4 hour workday wo work kind productivity requires enormous amount clarity undestanding everyone involved working hard get job done japan india two entirely different animals japan ageing workforce it also work environment emphasises employees working long hours the stress recent times resulted multiple news reports employees committing suicide prompted national outcry condemnation in addition balance also resulted men women choosing marry late choosing delay children this good considering already low population growth rate country this even led mechanisation many low end jobs japan ca find enough people work so 4 day work week might work country like japan carrying iniatives order promote population growth the 4 day work week high synergy objectives india meanwhile high population growth high unemployment young workforce the competition prompted firms cut costs order maintain profit this often means smaller workforce still amount work taking longer hours without commiserate increase remuneration even employee burned rat race india bad always enormous pool often applicants ready hired short notice lower pay so employers simply choose fire burned employees hire new recruits keep assembly line work long story short in japan employees still key human resource in india expendable tool many times work weekends anyways ca think change and wo matter clients work 5 days week your opinion matter the decision already made https the indian government suggested normal working day draft wage code rules stayed away fixing national minimum wage https 26 days work month which basically means 6 days week so yeah go fuck the government already decided 6 days week 9 hours day everybody bhai middle managers wo let happen mandated 5 day work week would start apart mncs central government offices everyone else works saturdays also would secondary effects move participation hobbies skill growth lower commute traffic congestion shall largely stimulating advantages overall

bangalore now even saturday sunday leave problem either work om weekends due emergency load much work deadlines end working weekend if deny manager say even went simply released 1000s ready work saturday sunday talk negative competition population explosion that like taking 3 steps time first jobs need hours long 6 days week generally people given work home even sundays not mention people

7,caste conundrum why upper castes believe discrimination exist,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjt8aBoejho,,i sorry hilarious time sad af especially thakur guy brahmin pandit no amount education gon na change people like sad say majority population india like brahman mandir ganta bhajate hai aur hum logoko bewakoof banate hai it sad see literates condoning casteism how fucked education system asking upper castes discrimination exists like asking white people racism exists shocking may seem white people say racism used exist 100 years ago maybe anymore here simple idea 90 humans right handed 10 left handed if look students gotten college found split right left handers indication something strange going if see necessarily indication left handers discriminated actively right handers genetically superior certainly something investigate if saw split saw mill might come conclusion right handers simply better hardworking deserving after interview process ask dominant hand poor performers fired if investigate realise tools designed right handers ask left hander know scissors inherent disadvantage means ca work effectively but never investigate never find and even fix nothing improve we need two things solve problem figuring solution implementing solution if solving problem would harm us would bother why would bunch right handers fix tools saw mill would increase competition jobs and reservation upper castes approx 30 population would take seats higher education reservation you might see think fair enough exam results look way but could potentially fix investing public education rural education if paid teachers 3x spent 10x teacher training 5x school facilities would bridge gap 20 30 years but wo because people power influence society send kids private schools anyway we personally affected problem lack opportunities fix like right handers wo fix tools if actually fixed india became egalitarian 30 society would get around 30 seats that situation currently 50 why would spend thousands crores actually reduce opportunities available kids we wo that reservation exists give opportunity folks went shitty schools shitty teachers shot better life and might reasonably ask look difference make all benefits go tiny minority people caste and right but forgetting two things firstly india people take care extended family the first person clan go college get good job mentors siblings cousins pays education brings and secondly although people lower castes wo actually benefit reservation still source hope they poor prospects not poor public education means kids prospects either but know they delude thinking kids could potentially go college reservation but horrible these poor people duped might think but works well rest us day downtrodden majority wakes realises kids hope burn society ground the happen reservation stopped hope better life no reservation sounds good but colleges burned you 100 seats 0 enjoy imho i grew city hyderabad life i personally seen untouchability extent needs much reservation i started engineering 2003 guy hari st bright lad speak english low self confidence would sit one day playing carroms 3 guys i invited play refused i literally drag play saw smile first time played end story from would smile year went second year i spoke casually doesnt talk anyone days started coming play carroms tt didnt answer i pestered weeks said i know everyones caste want pick fights i said want know caste said i st people dont like us touching sat next couple guys bench got know 3 next days told stories made felt village i guess people cities live bubble exposed lot atrocities oppression people villages face it still crazy realization i reservation answer i dont know if i show video one upper caste friends caste verge declared obc people caste expressed outrage due provocation upper castes never got declared obc say video scripted say made shit untouchability caste discrimination rare today removed most people base worldview statistic tables personal experiences taught worldview untouchability heavy caste based segregation oppression based caste based delineation especially towards dalits exists we decades decades statistical evidence prove but people grown kind environment hard rationalize acquired worldview first reaction vehemently deny altogether this caste climate change racism debates specific economic policies kashmir however kind anecdotal interviews valid privileged tier 1 urbanite going i never seen casteism fringe cases etc showing perspective fine trying use concrete evidence systemic caste based oppression around country less tenable i sc benefctor great eservation system reservation helped getting admission tier 1 college basics weak i came vernacular medium government operated school even though i got admission i still outcaste i rich vibes general category student solace i good sports made popular campus let get straight my view reservation cap additional regulation reservation primary secondary level education premier private schools government colleges now per present condition son avail reservation i think required wife brahmin i living tier 1 city atleast son faced caste discrimination my building watchmen brahmin salutes daily get tip procedure i forego son sc status son i happily if caste unspoken thing first foremost thing stop talking caste self start comes ca change elders change generation give guy good mic god sake genuinely asking what wrong reservation system based economics instead caste since lower caste individuals anyway disadvantaged economically accommodated at time rich people happen lower caste eligible thus allowing deserving lower economically disadvantaged person take place did watch video answer simple upper caste faced caste discrimination like dalits hence feel exist often guys question actually treat people well hence feel myth even large majority upper castes perpetuate caste discrimination sizeable population also tacit approval equally large number people also experience south atleast upper castes may sometimes arrogant quite open minded most caste discrimination done obcs end caste system end reservation its fuckin simple removed even though doubt caste discrimination also look side picture in urban areas castes becoming irrelevant one school friends 6 months ago told got seat punjab university sc his father mother also government job money never issue here take need reservation university well family i friends 10 years even knew sc suspect tell afraid see came therefore view even though economic components problem solve take social movement where people proud ancestors even though came lower castes removed i think like reservations based economic conditions either

i used see adivashi folks joining us training age much stronger core us credit hard work natural diet some used drive van rickshaw whole day summer heat came practice we still hard time beating heck

the real spike yet seen we may still surge cases too early say less cases 3 we know reson lower virulence indians a newly discovered mrna indians might protective lower levels ace2 there countries like australia well less mortality 4 we really position handle situation like new york lombardy edit we confirmed reports hospitals hiding positive cases edit 2 the hospital come press release admitting indeed 3 positive cases however known atleast 3 days they hid media atleast 3 days maybe i question though let say india 700 cases reality not testing would result low count would still sudden surge people reporting hospitals would or even sudden surge deaths related pneumonia i think numbers big claiming like 200k 500k range we would definitely seen situation hospitals would overloaded would difficult hide country like india for thinking true i would say wait for thinking tests i wish india capacity for want india done better india still poor nation would getting worse

percentages removed just negative nancy let forget indians like going docters prefer pretty sure many people especially age sitting home virus keeping mortality rate 1 i would state real number affected cases max could current near 1000 so factor 2 death rate reliable number cases countries democracy death toll india currently 20 since initial stage india take mortality rate 2 now calculating get roughly 1000 cases line currently 902 cases you add 100 200 1000 cases i believe government actively working problem major decisions regarding converting schools hospitals railway coach quarantine center developing new methods testing etc so indian need contribute efforts government way manner just like rape saudi arabia no report rape no test corona go corona think bangladesh they even crowded us i believe one densely populated countries world have heard much covid though so india hit rate tests while countries and india denying tests show how explain keyword may day 1 50 infected day 2 50 infected 500 edit r0 constant 10 permanently example numbers vary based precautions taken communities may higher lower rates spread may also mean r0 rise day day go day day please refer statistical data feel free calculate example satisfy reasoning behind using r0 10 inadequate tests spread rates partially evident 66 mild symptoms conservative side 80 sites once kept r0 0 considering contained incubation period one person easily come contact atleast also error wo day 2 500 day 2 incubation period started day 4 day 5 get 500 resulting possible 12 day delay actual show 50 500 6 days spread 8 days spreaded turn infected i may accidentally skipped info please let know comments breakdown 500 66 300 show mild symptoms immunity kicks fraction recover without even consulting doctor recovery period 1 week 1 week incubation period aka 2 weeks potential spreader get symptoms fraction practises quarantine meds gets better never realizing infected covid 19 group 33 200 show symptoms get worse progressively likely visit hospitals even small fraction get self treated may recover may die post mortem classified covid 19 death reports know covid 19 actual subset 200 people group show radar approx 4 days day 2 aka day due eventually finding also miss good chunk carriers tested add easily exponential growth actual cases severe followed day delay enough track maybe 50 cases 500 carriers possible absence widespread testing visualized mathematically easily remember factor methods verification positive case 10 actual infected carriers least likely tested quarantined also considering weather changes factors many symptoms common citizen may think weather change issue corona virus infection taking root so true that kerala shows cases check vigilantly i thinking exactly we know next days many cases pop explains kerala confirmed cases compared states more people tested put observation removed i think number deaths coming days reflect amount infected people deaths might better indicator take kerala example nearly 5k tested cases less 200 nri even contacted many people so even though testing done necessary end covid patients and country like india possible large number patients exist showing symptoms take treatment hospitals bangladesh with 200 mil people 48 effected 4 dead negative nancy the dance reason divorce rates dysfunction yes low cases count india think beginning becuase people stay home according view india enough resources controlling virus best tools maintain level stay home safe well thats actually true 2 days ago 21k tests conducted not shocked know people needed expert opinion know i think place blame we enough resources test widely which shame see i read somewhere calculate percentage people infected death count world comes know far 20 death far consider even 1 becomes around 2000 people there going sudden influx cases coming days definitely know deaths happening fact people community seem mild infection death rate much lower ground reality bad even authorized government hospitals interested taking samples i source i told dharavi local transmission switched community people sent back saying influenza most cases country local transmission 2 weeks blast cases well dead lack testing reason thanks nancy my theory since new year viruse started spreading since students china go studies countries badly affected italy direct flight fro wuhan combined people taking seriously italy caused serious damage us large number professionals escaping china usa bringing disease india hand large number students studying china returned quarantined immediately rest cases came chinese people infected countries spread infection since many students study brought disease but time proper precautions place but still due hard detect people shady things like travelling even though adviced self quarantine consuming paracetamol etc escape quarantine cause spread india in simple sense direct spread china usa china europe indirect spread china india still goi look what deal hydroxychloroquine azithromycin combination used treatment people hoarding medicines using prophylactiaclly statistics everyone please refer country wise day day growth in number cases 600 cases 4 days many country add 6xx positive infected many 4 days added crossed 6xx mark 4 day situation likely resemble exponential growth curve following countries ahead us might find country closest approximation spread us still approximation curves may exactly similar likely similar this major absurd lack testing no we medical care get t1 countries do judge us like we took precautions wayyyy lockdown reason many countried despite cases lockdown usa instance https with morning walks banned people become emboldened that basically point i making house past week not sure hygiene hypothesis works either way indian population insanely good immunity general young population tropical temperature lockdown going full force i think ever see big surge our healthcare system pretty solid even without resources manage hell daily basis and people actually taking quarantine social distancing seriously even remote village workers farm know basic dos follow rigorously

11,india first indigenous processor developed iit bombay i designer ama,https://i.redd.it/37dmt3wfnnt21.jpg,,well done op honestly shared details welcome ajit made india microprocessor https madhav desai team nine researchers iit bombay designed developed processor entirely institute the project funded ministry electronics information technology meity iit bombay powai labs company also invested venture market support product ajit features compared many microprocessors size available today market unlike ones used desktops like intel xeon ajit processor it used inside box control panel automation systems traffic light controller even robotic systems what researchers expect ajit cost less produced ajit run one instruction per clock cycle operate clock speeds comparable competitors market we working processor design two years the design tested programmable semiconductor chips began effort towards fabricating processor says desai the researchers made software tools associated ajit freely available everyone the processor also available softcore vendors buy license use design microprocessor fabricate use system the researchers also offer customise processor specific applications there lot info article eli5 different processors iitb planning use any risc using can run crysis whats next how going forward how different shakthi b in what kind hardware chips might end laptops may any plans mass producing have questions 1 which module part 2 which hdl processor coded 3 what technology node done and method building standard cell library 4 which used verification 5 what preferred method dft 6 can disclose layout package analysis si tools 7 which aspect processor according challenging 8 is fab i dying know cutting edge fab tech india been watching 2 decades thanks ama keep good work congratulations are going iterations final product and going dive mass production straightaway commercial applications milestep develop something even complex can run chrome five open tabs i non it guy accounts can someone explain significance was 1st microprocessor developed iit madras shakti how different compete intel can build low cost raspberry alternative chip or kind hardware specs yet integrated one realise functioning sbc diy maker community thanks ama i really interested field architecture does processor implement pipelining does dispatch instructions order implement order why risc what design team size iitb i assume final synthesis verification layout done cadence how many design cycles need taping final version sorry many questions once final version mass production course like try teach us entire computer built nand gate something like electronics case design ease fear improve understanding course come free time how much cost develop processor is developed iit madras which fabricated free oregon wow this amazing i guessing based open source hardware is architecture cpu available take look congratulations can give bit overview capable what kind skills would need become part something like i currently undergrad ece which subjects focus develop skills make chip like hey while i really commend ajit work iit bombay i feel quite ama need addressed this way critical ajit people aware information consume iit madras partnered bluespec work collaboration major part here implemented everything scratch untrue iit madras used bluespec language it like saying i used rust i worked collaboration mozilla now given op ama american company ajit developed india good now let tell developing language compiler hard that bluespec started mit one companies got right around 10 years experience field product really good processor dev also bluespec darpa funded programs increases confidence language bluespec happy give free licenses educational institutions do check finally code write bluespec owned writers yes pipelined processor thus mate expect make statements like designed processor your statement implies pipelined processor always so chips pipelined i give benefit doubt hope get across considered stable architecture many people around world proven architecture whereas sparc old proven architecture hence better choice i know get mate did know pixel 3 google core video https or nvidia going use gpu video https or western digital already committed replacing chips cores open source cores video https the notable company i knew anything developing sparc processors fujitsu supercomputers even moved arm we first caught wind supercomputer back june 2016 fujitsu unveiled architectural features future machine confirmed switch motors custom arm chip link https shakti built using proprietary software built scratch technically first one yes soc i ca reveal information ndas the compiler already exists provided gnu org so call india first indigenous processor call india first indigenous language india indigenous processor because shakti link https acm publication paper https safely claim designed anyways matter shakti even 10th fucking processor line miles would better https stopped making misinformed comments if call academician working prestigious place like iitb put bit thought responses are planning mba iima well what cost compared processor and clock speed what challenging part are electronics cse as cse student another iit sounds great development shows amount hard work guys put research congratulations ps hire next placement season what purpose creating processor do see india competent nation atleast terms necessary resources setting international industrial standards chip near future years summing use chips like anytime future early call shot congrats any plans retail development board what full form ajit will employ americans telephone support what biggest challenges when accomplished link detailed article https e2 80 e2 80 thanks congrats are going release publically like use phones computers or going reserved research purposes also better currently used processors seem interested get involved similar ambitions could please how good fabrication scl are going open source instruction set bootloader code etc where i download rtl opencores business perspective will india processor fabrication like it services do required raw materials process fabricate cost lesser importing one i general question china investing lot semiconductors order reduce chip imports it also companies like hisilicon aiming competing likes qualcomm india obviously quite yet voices calling years how realistic expectations when could see indian competitors kinds companies do think state needs step way china massive financial support think private sector collaboration academia thanks is tech used par international makers using where fall behind why would device maker use processor instead commercially available similar processors how far mass production will even mass produced remain lab experiment why think far behind space almost developed countries dozens fab plants india one why govt investing industry industry alone could give massive boost indian economy what instruction set deleted 1 does require motherboard compatible commercial available mobo 2 how compare current gen cpu intel amd like processor comparable 3 how much ram supoort how far mass production when could see company announcing real world products i really question wanted congratulate entire team hope endeavor continues even greater heights well done deleted that fucking cool kitna deti hai i know much processors tech india looks cool upvote we told making vjti one time girish kumar mentioned congratulations completion now call america support respect bro a wonderful achievement i hope see india producing microprocessors likes intel amd flagship microprocessors cheap rate paving new generation microprocessors betterment technology country soon enough congrats made us proud btech mtech honest question started ama sunday past midnight fabrication 10 nm x86 arm something new can run crysis deleted which architecture dose support max data carrying crunching capacity processor where get fabrication done do think get mobile phone manufacturers set high volume fabrication assembly already places plants india congratulations quite happy see development processor india can list issues facing semi conductor development fabrication sector country like single fab company that manufacturers devices could use what distance transistors how get process creating how differ processors terms performance efficiency i assuming must caveats new project please mention specs details are looking make industry standard yes advantage intel similar popular processors first many many so future plans only use systems applications mentioned or near future commercialization plans processor used pc how involed manner kind process within project damn keen development deleted was shakti first one how similar two major applications could please share processor node based is market ready still kind prototype if market ready next plans use mp but real question game risc based how compared currently available type processors thanks ama some questions i 1 what tools use apr and iit bombay good license support 2 you mentioned moving 65 fab would made 3 does scl supply memory compilers 4 how much chip made custom 5 why use vhdl instead system verilog why named ajit man we already got ajit pai meme dude tried destroy internet soon ajit processor meme earth would name processor ajit why something like arjun drona bhishma ram shiv karna karma duryodhan ravan hanuman bajrang vayu trimorti bheem anything else so different shakti processor iit madras this looks really cool what desktop processor compare terms performance i answered lot questions short i think i come back bit please keep questions coming i really excited upcoming questions where plan get fabricated 65nm is scl starting fabrication 65nm is mass production going happen india abroad i read said mass produced aim 100rs possible done within india does india advantage starting late field like lack credit cards okay since leap frogged finance apps credit do know much processors looks gorgeous this exicitng nano meter also think able mass produce if ajit comparable performance speed commercially available processor made past one would equate any reason behind name ajit also congrats good luck what incentive businesses design products using processor does require external cooling or ihs enough cool processor what kind power consumption handle also what kind tdp applies you made proud happy op need how complicated manufacturing processor process node are public papers transistor performance compares competitors what pros cons x86 arm congratulations d how commercially viable processor when arm intel amd flooded market do plans sell dev kits like raspberry pi what exactly built ground is isa is underlying vlsi is actual fab done india can make sandwich what next it 2019 ffs congratulations op you guys accomplished enormous task i proud people some questions mind guys planning release soc 64 bit future many transistors able run linux kernel challenging part design ajit why make time sooner what challenges stopped us making processor earlier decades there really famous efficient processors readily available market affordable price are planning get project level research purposes compare something like arm7 arm m4 i installed chip like hand hand formed hand soldered this remarkable feat causes brief flashback aside awesome technical accomplishment i must also acknowledge pleasing aesthetic product congratulations hey great work indeed how big dimensions current processor i buy development board ever one available does built serial uart where design you made point could tell us specifications transistor size density etc what level clean room available 100 techniques used lithography masks i also intrigued code hardware thing i guess specialized hardware runs orders magnitude faster opposed generalized ones would possible make chip particular time consuming program say photo shop matlab making much cheaper hardware wise wish use singular purpose making sort cartridges like used case nes video games making impossible pirate software also specialized machines sem tem run way old computer software 95 98 invest drivers newer version windows would possible replace controller machines single use computer also anyone working quantum computing people trying build scratch would better could jump more like mobile revolution happened india skipping landline revolution op suggest resources 8086 iwtl i genuine doubt something called what really mean hope captures diy market helps developing prototype projects quickly congratulations success even though dont know anything computers but looks interesting well done could guy run linux what sort provide ethernet gpio i2c etc manufactured btw great job what name any chances cooler name appeals millennials why naming it sucks get ambitious name atleast first congratulations its great achievement does instruction set is risc cisc how come newspapers reddit celebrate achievements come iits iisc this awesome congrats but since mentioned future i wondering team ready bypass patents chip manufacturing eg developed patentable creative way developing without interfering prior arts i wonder military use foreign chipsets maybe reverse engineering make sure would sufficient enough cost effective how many masks needed fabricate how long take launch market and improvements looking please state specs is reference manual compiler what advantages developing microprocessor compared picking arm reference architecture customizing requirements how much cooling require is passively cooled asking since clock speed something ghz x200b what kind motherboard accessories require work what things ram hardware controllers like storage things sorry question clear i much chip guy lol chance micro like peripherals congrats how long whole project take reach prototype what power consumption prototype how come rs 100 estimate mass produced cost what minimum feature node fab process ajit do power consumption performance meet envisioned use case satellite deployment hiya op i glad guys done quite something plan building anything future desktop grade architecture cheers isa processor benchmarks architecture used produce risc yay considering many processors currently market could please tell us compares rather better could also lay difference cost comparing processors category now fabricated india see future microprocessor fabrication country edit would compare arm raspberrypi can expect commercially available home projects can run minesweeper what benchmark processor wish compare popular ones will commercialized actually able compete processors big companies cost less rs100 produced mass scale how much processor specs cost market what assumed profit margin product does work what educational background i need join team reading comments i ca help wonder ama supreme example ama deleted hi i couple questions 3 infact 1 why indigenous processors compete likes giants like intel amd qualcomm exynos kirin i mean long greatest brains country 2 not offending anyone could probably reverse engineered process taken help engineers previously worked companies why start scratch why start mhz why directly ghz atleast 1 ghz would good enthusiasts would probably buy instead raspberry pi provide funding research 3 at rate long think take reach competitive level terms nm please say near future which programmable chip i assuming fpga use testing ajit i try hpc around xilinx devkits really good combining softcores provide arm processor build complete embedded system accelerate hardware use arm existing computational capabilities 1 how long take complete entire asic flow 2 is spec sheet available im indigenous think bit late processor making race even mobile processors achieved ghz capacity half dozen parallel cores integrated peripherals even catch big players market still need build ecosystem around think i agree start use low frequency processors lot military industrial household equipments microwaves washing machines guys looking niche within going heavy computing future and kinda feel government wants make headlines every government india support long term also huge opportunity feels great part something big how diversity public institutions support kind leg room technological research kudos brother sister hearty congratulations achievements brutal question do plan implement secret cpu running inside processor complete remote access similar intel amd if would takle pressure government authorities case mandated benchmarks pls reading ajit chip triggers ajit pai nonetheless kudos achievement op team can run crysis hi i interested designing microchips processors being part team develops products awesome i currently way enter mtech vlsi one nits can suggest essential help get industry i electronics background circuits always fascinated wrong iit madras developed processor nov 2018 looks like arc reactor ironman 2 square instead triangle one question though different processors market despite would produced india planning mass produce and congratulations marks success i initially thought carom board when mass produced so started wafer level how get etching done that nice insanely costly thing make one chip any plans build gpus kudos success i query what description ajit was shakti first one please correct i wrong how many nanometers can compete stm 32 what architecture is new one comparable stm 32 architecture btw riscv based shakti released processor all i see going embedded market every story i read describes ajit microprocessor are planning making microcontroller architecture meant processor i mean 32bit 100mhz uc approx 2usd would sweet although i marketability standpoint understand went sparc v8 i guess licensing arm would render chip expensive i going stick avr arm i wish good luck ajit does needful papa ne nahin bola sharma ji ka beta intel making 10nm processors show bobs vagna risc v arch i guess run architecture benchmark link details would appreciated nice work though will requirement operating system kernel developer what applications i really intersted learning stuff designing processors processors work book recommendations but run crisis do hope rival processor manufacturers intel amd processing power or aiming excel standards would say price would similar cheaper and final question would also manufacture cooling system best suits new processor light weight highly efficient if got complete support is nanotechnology buzzword make impact thank sharing just curious choose c oh wow gaming mind looked similar pc processor lol im still amazed hopefully technological boost needed push india forefront technological development used raspberry pi learning yes commercially available cheaper price pi can i play skyrim i salute anyway where see india next 10 years particular field are mega plans vision policy government regarding how theoretical front original research output generating how compare intel amd cpus what jee score following moore always reaching current configurations cpu around 20 years op or shorter but still amazing i seen productions lines seems hella crazy much precision care methods great work can run crysis how different better silicon based processors silicon valley i curious prabot work powai labs will still follow moore law congratulations iit kharagpur even though much slower industry standard processors around world i still proud achievement done india hopefully government start funding towards i technical guy possibility project sometime future scaled motherboard go laptops made india indian market i sick people always bragging electronics cheaper overseas lengths people go save 100 laptops asking overseas cousins get mobiles laptops i really like see laptops electronics developed india rest world all following question eli5 level 1 can comparison processor 2 can processors reverse engineered hard reverse engineer processor 3 who giants field processors d 4 what key obstacles development processors 5 what kind equipments needed manufacture product machineries india machineries required mass produce product also cost manufacturing product say processor 6 took many years india produce processor companies like intel selling millions 7 i see every month developed processor launched i3 i5 i7 could able produce current version months ago come able produce 6 months produce 8 what highest potential current processor technology 9 i heard quantum processors next generation processors different quantum processor technology current processor technology 10 if superconductor effect would world processor what programming language arm he answered 2 questions count pretty softball ones pack boys this starting look like arnoob goswami ama propaganda finest i wonder processor even exists another fabrication government propaganda heard based havard architecture instead von neumann why removed i thought shakti india first microprocessor does run could tell brats iit arrogant bet works well testicles pc wow salute guy made india proud does toilet kitna deti hai why india make hard business countries non tech guy is chip mobile processor i hope believe indians would finally stop leaking top talent countries find way implore staying i feel extremely bad incredible talent nation generates leaves ends fighting find way find citizenship another country opposed leading greatness i one i feel ashamed fact every day hopefully one day i return pride jaihind can run crysis why would i want use lets say core i9 ryzen 7 do plan competing kind tasks mainstream processing

future action you say pivot points let us say spy reaching everybody says important support what mean will break support if breaks go much lower bounce back reclaim support again know today spy broke bounced support 3 4 times definitively breaking which definitive it clear hindsight now make clear essence uninformed trader trading blind that means charitably speaking chances asset moving favorable direction but still lose there two reasons one relates way trades happen human psychology if place limit buy limit sell order execute ticker moving unfavorably that stock moving limit buy price buy order execute and moving beyond limit sell price sell order execute in case unless closing trade immediately loss price continues movement if price moving much immediately loss due spread and likely bought thought bargain recent past showed downward price movement bullish more often price movement continues direction reversals rare hard time this means b you immediately pain you see loss likely see widening price movement continues now many options you exit trade loss bummer ii you execute another trade direction average price this suffers problem the price moving away orders execute your new trade uninformed last one iii you hold bag hoping reversal both ii iii holding bag let us talk usually price continue move see red becoming redder you regret trade you stressed you averaged 3 maybe 4 times already you want least exit therefore soon price reverses shows modest profit itch book profit relax hence make understandable trader mistake holding losers quitting winners after trade shows green experienced red afraid go red you wanting go pain therefore usually see losers portfolio loss 20 even 50 never see kind profit ever you would booked profit 2 5 so consequence even assuming trade chance going way losses always bigger winners eventually curse trading seek gainful employment hope helpful what use stop limits market orders trade momentum this work time how determine momentum going continue reverse soon but main problem stops if tight stop volatility take if wide stop loss wide figuring proper stop based pivot points past realized volatility straightforward work

11,hi reddit i srinivas kodali a independent researcher documenting aadhaar npr projects ask anything,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/efg21t/hi_reddit_im_srinivas_kodali_a_independent/,hey folks i srinivas kodali i independent researcher working various internet communities campaigns i documenting aadhaar npr associated databases india past years ask anything edit guys i ending ama hang around post updates coming months npr,on request srinivas sent us following text explaining significance npr i originally added announcement post the national population register old project whose pilot implementation dates back 1986 rural rajasthan the project came mainstream kargil war 1999 india realised ca identify foreigners indians during conference chief ministers internal security 2001 project approved part project every indian supposed distributed multi purpose national identity cards essentially smart card fingerprints stored chip while project piloted india went another attack mumbai pakistani terrorists posing fishermen this first time cards started distributed fishermen but post due heavy intelligence failures multiple databases like natgrid cctns cms aadhaar poppped aadhaar project npr similar so deal cabinet combined registar general india became registrar uidai started distributing aadhaar the deal npr get biometrics uidai post supreme court stopped ordering biometrics shared anyone after npr project continued updated part 2011 census 2015 the project start national register citizens npr data used disclose list citizens ones classified foreign residents when data college npr people submit documents verification let clear elephant room is npr innocent government makes sound the kerala wb govt stopped working npr citing concerns turn nrc also actually take 8000crores find what sorts tools software programs use research npr data sets in opinion project result gerrymandering like happens us parties draw redraw constituency favor chances party winning i two questions 1 how think govt balance privacy security both seem opposite if govt wants grant citizens privacy online offline pose security threat wo able identify terrorists if govt want tighten security monitoring data online surveillance putting surveillance cameras everywhere offline surveillance becomes privacy nightmare citizen democratic country so govt balance privacy security citizens 2 related think data protection bill recently brought parliament it feels like govt focussing security aspect privacy context i explained the bill supposed give privacy citizens feels like bill gone opposite direction what thoughts questions thanks lot my questions 1 while npr citizenship act census census act data collected together can shared two is possibility npr data used delimitation given census data clause hinted tweet https https 2 how accurate ec voter list purification exercises do know duplicates voter list or excuse delete voters might vote favour 3 given bjp multiple lies delays nrc rules implement caa think really mind how protesters go there women shaheen bagh sitting outside many days what aim what i refuse give data hola any plans anthologize years work put amazing work safeguarding knowledge more people need know also knowledge city hyderabad something share us how npr data along aadhar used winning elections pointed thread is designed way people citizens default unless sarkari babu handpicks individuals families wish issues notice doubtfull citizenship status this way majority population harassed exercise are leaving extremely delicate problem deciding citizenship entire family hands random babus may may employed base target specifically muslims how ensure data entered legit since i read furnishing proof verification i provide 2 aadhar detail birth certificate refuse give dl hi srinivas thanks you say point census npr practically i think primary difference comes come is true census data supposed confidential anonymized data collected npr broader set anyway tied individual also made public nrc objections so true npr direct connection nrc in article https https conclude the government use data identify people randomly create registries created multitude problems it time put check upcoming data protection could elaborate kinds problems also saw news reports said given biometrics uidai need give npr then prakash javdekar said biometrics taken npr does mean uidai give biometrics npr is violation aadhar act in ways npr different census trying see government point view what safeguards people give accurate data compelled give documents i understand nrc culled npr verification documents is ridiculously inefficient why verify npr stage hi k what see role state level govt databases given many use architecture based aadhaar seeding link npr least paper do think could issue decentralised action sympathetic state level agencies using data even nrc doesnt materialise union govt what think issues raised subreddit privacy issues like revealing phone numbers family info https bank info etc also gov saying aadhar proof citizenship made citizen 500rs how npr impacts nris oci card holders what major glaring concerns aadhaar npr fact government many many data points names is realistic fear misuse data government why govt many schemes registers aadhar npr nrc cant single database links documents like dl passport voter id etc deleted data collected npr give 360 degree view citizen the government immense data citizen the problems regarding surveillance aadhaar seem minuscule front every possible data point collected i sure data weaponized current regime could please list various ways affect people even parties yet stand nrc affected digitaldutta question would project render internationally accepted citizenship proofs like passport would folks living various visas countries need come back prove citizenship also birth certificates easiest forge per experience growing seeing done piecemeal so become race i know guy knows guy get one citizenship india what government much data is future plan shooting arrows dark why mandatory furnish aadhar passport details npr what implications i deny ar technical differences aadhar npr from month npr going start 1 will govt verify data provided if yes 2 you said govt already lot data citizens use instead npr preparation nrc what makes npr useful govt nrc 3 the key aspect citizenship born 1987 currently lineage traced generations govt verify info place date birth parents key aspect 4 what homeless tribals info collected 5 you said npr began 2001 upa also intention use nrc cab thing brings communal issue 6 on basis filter npr nrc lists 7 besides upgrade exercise right name 2011 2015 npr removed dont provide info thanks advance what mean say aadhaar passport pan card proof citizenship how else prove citizens so upcoming data protection bill government snoop citizens private data like messages emails medical history etc without court warrant i college batchmate friend facebook so excited seeing evolved years hello sir where i read aadhar details like works effects democracy mass surveillance etc etc blog old articles plz link or suggest blog writer book thanks are changes data collection old npr 2001 new npr and process going start can link aadhar phone number authorised phone shops

getting due appreciation although i think kanta bai interesting character deserves better arc wish see upcoming seasons i really loved design references mythology guys show whose idea incorporate elements show they added great new dimension rarely see indian shows did think casting nana patekar role gaitonde personally i felt nawazuddin match imho the character anjali mathur said quite different book why decision make feminist kinda character made amidst characters characterisations radhika apte character notion religion upbringing specific geography etc sartaj sardar gaitonde hindu maharashtra was intentional characterisation given raw agent her role somehow seemed unchanged lust stories sacred games for varun who rely proofread writings find gaps suggest improvements hi could

product top 5 foreign movies watched to vg write sequence altered screen cuss words what colour film was choice dictated netflix hi vikram varun grover i read book i think character arc sartaj singh similar real life filmmaker sartaj witnesses parulkar killed junaid even though armed etc sartaj gets angry walks hearing since ca see injustice happening etc but much later see sartaj becomes part system gives statement favour parulkar thus empowers parulkar probably parulkar aware nothing happen everyone favour hence committed crime matter honest colleagues this similar filmmaker came know partner filmmaker involved sexual harrasment got angry wanted set things right eventually favored colleague let continue work thus becoming part patriarchy system ended empowering colleague curious know arc inspired real story will get osts digital platforms series smart thinking divine kaam 25 fire hi vikram i want know glass wall gaitonde hiding place inspired glass wall jimmy office better call saul https hey vikram favourite scenes make final cut can share anything i love vince gilligan breaking bad better call saul i heard motwane specially love two use simple recurring personal

writing i super curious know when expect second season any tip netfilx side 1 how exactly hearing gaitonde narrator voice killed is exposition happening sartaj imagination or gaitonde much time phone

dumb ass star kids your take of course i talking opinion nepotism bollywood hello lovers art my question do many coming particular scenes mind right beginning the best one i saw gaitonde young kid saying apun ko naya dharam mangta tha buddha going search truth buddhism hey guys loved series mainstream bollywood still seems live dream world rich kids facing limp conflicts rural india shown clean colorful set issues any body traveled even urban rural areas knows dirty grimy romanticization shitty things india spirit mumbai gone far our people always attend movies everything rosy fucked things country shown memes unto movies lot ways define culture mainstream bollywood seems understand they think entertainment innocent any thoughts regarding in endeavor articulating present state able pull veneer fall trap glossing society actually baring open see side india are also writing creating keeping mind dire need articulate society get people finally see gaping holes rapidly decaying culture apologies comes rambling would love conversation around subhadra one episodes speaks ganpati festival means people celebrating it made much sense rajshri i believe took next level wanted know whose

vikram lot outdoor night scenes used lot obviously yellow lighting apart obvious street lighting aesthetic deliberate creative choice set particular tone while i loved sacred games i found disappointing every time female character gained importance killed can future seasons what overall budget sg how compare typical bollywood movie hey also i wondering in writing show look inspiration what films stories serials helped shape idea telling stories why directing season 2 why ganesh kill chota badariya hi vikram varun here questions 1 many artists keep team creative process diluted you hand pretty much active social media also end acknowledging reviews fans criticism does response help change process would rather stick conviction 2 hey varun since back stand expect special also favorite upcoming stand comics india i loved series many layered narratives when expect next season hi varun vikram excellent job script direction i wanted know who wrote dialogues part anurag directed 1 can talk inspirations visual look series i feel sacred games really embraced dingy 3rd world tube light lighting prevalent india 2 does director take hdr consideration planing shots dp your favorite tv show movie hi varun will comments recent indian political history show may period i wondering gaitonde hindi would north indian accent opposed strong marathi slant given background upbringing was considered which favourite tv show sacred games hi everyone vikramaditya motwane anurag kashyap aside would individual choices directing two segments and director affect tv series significantly given tight scripts follow bhagwan mein vishwas karte ho how different similar personal concept god one portrayed series what precautions take writing present indian audience great work guys liberating experience prolonged engagement realistically portrayed fleshed characters never understood people get emotionally involved sports team connection untill i saw quality product delivered felt little vicarious pride part context sad say havent felt patriotic recent years was option cast anyone else apart saif ali khan main lead hello directing season 2 any book would like adapt and relationship parulkar changed book why chota badariya killed hello vikram since varun grover satirical commentary religious fanaticism exceptionally well see directing episodes next season if gaitonde dead narrating story edit a word have either following fan theories going around how experience making show knowledge cbfc involved did control netflix side guidelines netflix pass

lead going reveal sartaj megha back story anytime soon is similarity character gaitonde real life don chhota rajan isa dawood spin sartaj singh varun considering always advocate gender equal society feminist general taking account big impact hit movies shows watchers think use expletives involving women could avoided did netflix impose sort restrictions sacred games stage like amazon prime video

advice amateur screenplay writers want make name future when netflix anounced season 2 accurately netflix anounced season 2 after response received show mature think indian audience gotten years and think pace sacred games average show time come why gaitonde ended buying rolce royce instead red car if someone got good script pitch guys satisfied line dialogue delivered gaitonde cuckoo death says main bhagwan ke bhi upar h looked bit odd how nawazuddin siddiqui nudity vikram favourite black mirror sorry hindi translation seemed bit crucial moments like sartaj katekar says आई hindi captions

favourite food drink joints i find i currently reading book watching tv series i found lot storylines changed for example cuckoo minor character book sartaj honest among others what going mind started writing show what motivated make changes one two examples helpful i loved show ca wait next season so questions 1 was saif first choice sartaj singh 2 did expect bofors line become big controversy how find rahul gandhi response 3 why choose netflix online streaming platforms how experience how much liberty given vikram chandra visualising book did need approvals the main villian every dialogue cringy supposed guys could find someone else hey vikram bhavesh joshi superhero end saving city nuclear attack you two industry long time might watched many artist still struggling necessarily mean creating something tight amazing sg scale large netflix i hope get idea is anything different people would like share young people looking forward entering industry beginning journey artists the fact gaitonde killed mother left bewildered why kill mother what actually thought father best actors parulkar katekar cuckoo nawajuddin why dubbing indian languages do add tamil varun wrote marathi dialogues some puns really good i think saif ali khan aka satraj plays little role kind biased see name appear first name actors nawazuddin siddiqui name appeared first saif awesome sardarji expect sequel great work show ca wait season 2 how bold films tv shows brought mainstream media how aspiring screenwriters think write like sacred games go who approach is trivedi dead alive udaan one fav

announcement two days ago i listened sunil abraham said best way beat surveillance threat aadhaar make information biometric demographic publicly available that way could always maintain deniability someone stole identity in case aadhaar today would think practical idea smart thing the idea identity info supposedly unique accessible realistically someone else steals identity nefarious activites accused legally given identity supposedly accessible leaving tracks burden proof would fall prove which might get difficult on hand make biometrics publicly available illegal immediately argue the burden proof would accuser prove really using identity it like using guy fawkes mask or printing mask face everyone wearing i glad couple days i thought i miss thanks question as per existing aadhaar

11,ama shakti team,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/96xwjg/ama_with_shakti_team/,hi we team students project staff iit madras working shakti processor program we recently one cores intel 22 ffl technology node successful powering chip booting linux this io heavy test chip meant provide poc proof concept meant direct consumption we excited answer queries ask us anything our new website https edit thanks queries it pleasure interacting guys glad see many tech enthusiasts hope see new ama new processor we signing thanks,hi i excited see taking ama i heard recent tapeout shakti cores the second public tapeout world congratulations i questions 1 i understand stages software design hardware opaque can give us overview stages processor design what stages cost time which ones take manpower 1a i remember reading amd zen team spent 2 million man hours 4 years design replacement excavator since i understand much hardware small group entrepreneurs academics hope put enormous amount effort needed build validate processor design 2 can elaborate power performance area especially security design goals server desktop class processors i read website mentions features clockrate processors compared best intel server desktop chips 2018 performance goal 50 good 80 2a i asking commit delivering chips time frame due ignorance hardware i idea long chip design efforts take to meet design goals servers desktop detailed 2 long estimate take team design chips 5 years 10 years 3 i given understand x86 processor family designed security the processor design grew organically time full holes swiss cheese what systematic hardware software design changes taking avoid security failures x86 arm mips family 4 i concerned security chips the chip design world spending lot time money formally verify isa creating chip designs writing drivers hardware level software c almost 50 years prove insecure i understand need write code c linux related matters i expect change however considered using secure languages like rust software i pointing whatever language use project going use 50 years i really want using insecure software 2068 have given thought you stated six eight versions cores i seen progress three what timeline rest processors another question have guys considered copyleft license project like cern open hardware license licenses allow transfer intellectual property whereas copyleft licenses like cohl keep pool intellectual property public domain using permissive license like bsd make easy companies take design make proprietary right license want create open hardware ecosystem why would company like samsung take design put 250 million dollars investment take next level quality bsd license allows apple show take results samsung hard work make proprietary bsd linux projects around length time linux taken world bsd stagnant companies use permissive licenses software unless control stack core part business permissive licences create silos open hardware community needs copyleft license due incentives license creates i expect companies academics take work give anything back an open hardware community based team work impossible have considered changing shakti project license hey first great job congratulations what advice would give 2nd year student loves processors wants learn build where would start resources books software etc
